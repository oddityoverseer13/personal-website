<h2>Released</h2>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.colorado.edu/map">University of Colorado Campus Map</a> - This was a to replace the existing outdated, poorly designed <a href="http://www.colorado.edu/campusmap">CU campus map</a>. For more information about the project, see <a href="http://www.colorado.edu/map/about.html">the map's about page</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/oddityoverseer13/webtrees-openstreetmap">Openstreetmap Webtrees plugin</a> - This is a plugin for <a href="http://www.webtrees.net">Webtrees</a> to enable display of map locations on an Leaflet/OSM map. There are plans to make it better in the future.</a>
</ul>
<h2>In Progress</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Bing housenumber detection - For my CS senior project, which is sponsored by Microsoft's Bing Maps department, I'm working with a group of other CS students to develop a system that extracts the house numbers from Bing's Streetside imagery, using computer vision algorithms. The project is being developed using NodeJS, OpenCV, and the Bing maps API. Our current plan is to host it on Microsoft's Azure cloud hosting environment. The project is still in early phases of development, but it's already offering many exciting challenges and some promising preliminary results.</li>
  <li><a href="http://davidql.github.io/localtrek">PerfectPath</a> - In my Startup Essentials class, we're tasked with coming up with a potential business idea, and developing the idea into something that would interest potential customers. The current iteration of my group's idea is to provide a service for goal-oriented shoppers to access provide optimal paths to visit locations relevant to their needs. <b>This is very much a work in progress, and the site will change on a day-to-day basis. The description may not reflect our current direction.</b></li>
</ul>
<h2>On Hold</h2>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/oddityoverseer13/kinship">Kinship</a> - A Ruby on Rails genealogy application. Development for this started out as a project for a CS class, and now I'm working on developing into an alternative to <a href="http://www.webtrees.net">Webtrees</a>. <i>Development of this is backburnered, mostly because I need to find a good way to host files, since Heroku doesn't really support that on it's own. </i></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/oddityoverseer13/musicjs">MusicJS</a> (working title) - This is a desktop music management application, powered by node-webkit (nodejs+chromium). I started development on this after switching to archbang for my desktop environment, and trying to find a good music management application (an alternative to MediaMonkey). For more info, see the readme in the repo. <i>This is on hold until I get some time to work on it some more.</i></li>
  <li><a href="http://github.com/oddityoverseer13/berries">Berries</a> - A 3D Mapping library. This started out as a project for a CS graphics class, where I explored WebGL and three.js. The intent will be for this to be a 3D alternative to <a href="http://www.leafletjs.com">Leaflet</a>. <i>This is on hold because it has a lower priority than other projects.</i></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/oddityoverseer13/z-rts-game">Zombie RTS Game</a> - This is obviously a working title. The intent is to create a zombie real time strategy game. The twist is that it would take place in the real world, using OSM for a data source. Through this project, I'm exploring node.js, websockets, and other such web technologies. <i>This project is on hold until I get some more done on Berries (see above), so I can explore the option of setting the game in a 3D world.</i></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/oddityoverseer13/webtrees-svgtree">Webtrees SVG Tree Plugin</a> - The objective of this is to create an alternative to webtrees' existing tree views, which are all based on HTML tables (ick). This plugin uses SVG to create a tree view of the genealogy data in the site. The other improvement this plugin aims to make is the ability to show a "kinship" tree; ie: one that shows siblings, and spouses, in addition to ancestors and decendants. <i>This project is on hold in favor of Kinship (see above) development.</i></li>
</ul>
