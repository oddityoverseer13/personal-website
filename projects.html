<h2>Finished</h2>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.colorado.edu/map">University of Colorado Campus Map</a> - This was a to replace the existing outdated, poorly designed <a href="http://www.colorado.edu/campusmap">CU campus map</a>. For more information about the project, see <a href="http://www.colorado.edu/map/about.html">the map's about page</a></li>

</ul>
<h2>In Progress</h2>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/oddityoverseer13/musicjs">MusicJS</a> (working title) - This is a desktop music management application, powered by node-webkit (nodejs+chromium). I started development on this after switching to archbang for my desktop environment, and trying to find a good music management application (an alternative to MediaMonkey). For more info, see the readme in the repo.</li>
</ul>
<h2>On Hold</h2>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/oddityoverseer13/kinship">Kinship</a> - A Ruby on Rails genealogy application. Development for this started out as a project for a CS class, and now I'm working on developing into an alternative to <a href="http://www.webtrees.net">Webtrees</a>.<i>Development of this is backburnered, mostly because I need to find a good way to host files, since Heroku doesn't really support that on it's own. </i></li>
  <li><a href="http://github.com/oddityoverseer13/berries">Berries</a> - A 3D Mapping library. This started out as a project for a CS graphics class, where I explored WebGL and three.js. The intent will be for this to be a 3D alternative to <a href="http://www.leafletjs.com">Leaflet</a>.<i>This is on hold because it has a lower priority</i></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/oddityoverseer13/z-rts-game">Zombie RTS Game</a> - This is obviously a working title. The intent is to create a zombie real time strategy game. The twist is that it would take place in the real world, using OSM for a data source. Through this project, I'm exploring node.js, websockets, and other such web technologies. <i>This project is on hold until I get some more done on Berries (see above), so I can explore the option of setting the game in a 3D world.</i></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/oddityoverseer13/webtrees-svgtree">Webtrees SVG Tree Plugin</a> - The objective of this is to create an alternative to webtrees' existing tree views, which are all based on HTML tables (ick). This plugin uses SVG to create a tree view of the genealogy data in the site. The other improvement this plugin aims to make is the ability to show a "kinship" tree; ie: one that shows siblings, and spouses, in addition to ancestors and decendants. <i>This project is on hold in favor of Kinship (see above) development.</i></li>
</ul>
