			"\n<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Ah, Thomas Covenant,&quot; she sighed, &quot;it is my\ndream to see those horses. Most. of my people are too content-they do not\ntravel, and have not seen so much as a Woodhelven. But I wish to walk the\nPlains of Ra, and see the horses galloping.&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>After a long pause, she resumed: &quot;These mountains are\nthe Southron Range. Behind them are the Wastes, and the Gray Desert. No life or\npassage is there; all the Land is north and west and east from us</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>And we stand on Kevin's Watch, where the highest of the Old\nLords stood at the last battle, before the coming of the Desolation. Our people\nremember that, and avoid the Watch as a place of ill omen. But Atiaran my\nmother brought me here to teach me of the Land. And in two years I will be old\nenough to attend the Loresraat and learn for myself, as my mother did. Do you\nknow,&quot; she said proudly, &quot;my mother has studied with the\nLorewardens?&quot; She looked at Covenant as if she expected him to be impressed.\nBut then her eyes fell, and she murmured, &quot;But you are a Lord, and know\nall these things. You listen to my talk so that you may laugh at my\nignorance.&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>Under the spell of her voice, and the pressure of his\nvertigo, he had a momentary vision of what the Land must have looked like after\nKevin had unleashed the Ritual of Desecration. Behind the luminous morning, he\nsaw hills ripped barren, soil blasted, rank water trickling through vile fens\nin the riverbed, and over it all a thick gloom of silence-no birds, no insects,\nno animals, no people, nothing living to raise one leaf or hum or growl or\nfinger against the damage. Then sweat ran into his eyes, blurred them like\ntears. He pulled away from the view and seated himself again with his back to\nthe wall. &quot;No,&quot; he murmured to Lena, thinking, You don't understand.\n&quot;I did all my laughing-long ago.&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>Now he seemed to see the way to go forward, to flee the dark\nmadness which hovered over him. In that brief vision of Desolation, he found\nthe path of the dream. Skipping transitions so that he would not have to ask or\nanswer certain questions, he said, &quot;I've got to go to the Council of\nLords.&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>He saw in her face that she wanted to ask him why. But she\nseemed to feel that it was not her place to question his purpose. His mention\nof the Council only verified his stature in her eyes. She moved toward the\nstair. &quot;Come,&quot; she said. &quot;We must go to the Stonedown. There a\nway will be found to take you to Revelstone.&quot; She looked as if she wanted\nto go with him.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>But the thought of the stair hurt him. How could he\nnegotiate that descent? He could not so much as look over the parapet without\ndizziness. When Lena repeated, &quot;Come,&quot; he shook his head. He lacked\nthe courage. Yet he had to keep himself active somehow. To Lena's puzzlement,\nhe said, &quot;How long ago was this Desolation?&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I do not know,&quot; she replied soberly. &quot;But\nthe people of the South Plains came back across the mountains from the bare\nWastes twelve generations past. And it is said that they were forewarned by\nHigh Lord Kevin-they escaped, and lived in exile in the wilderness by nail and\ntooth and rhadhamaerl lore for five hundred years. It is a legacy we do not\nforget. At fifteen, each of us takes the Oath of Peace and we live for the life\nand beauty of the Land.&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>He hardly heard her; he was not specifically interested in\nwhat she said. But he needed the sound of her voice to steady him while he\nsearched himself for strength. With an effort, he found another question he\ncould ask. Breathing deeply, he said, &quot;What were you doing in the\nmountains-why were you up where you could see me here?&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I was stone-questing,&quot; she answered. &quot;I am\nlearning suru-pa-maerl. Do you know this craft?&quot; &quot;No,&quot; he said\nbetween breaths. &quot;Tell me.&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;It is a craft I am learning from Acence my mother's\nsister, and she learned it from Tomal, the best Craftmaster in the memory of\nour Stonedown. He also studied for a time in the Loresraat. But suru-pa-maerl\nis a craft of making images from stones without binding or shaping. I walk the\nhills and search out the shapes of rocks and pebbles. And when I discover a\nform that I understand, I take it home and find a place for it, balancing or\ninterlocking with</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>other forms until a new form is made.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Sometimes, when I am very brave, I smooth a roughness\nto make the joining of the stones steadier. In this way, I remake the broken\nsecrets of the Earth, and give beauty to the people.&quot; -- Vaguely, Covenant\nmurmured, &quot;It must be hard to think of a shape and then find the rocks to\nfit it.&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;That is not the way. I look at the stones, and seek\nfor the shapes that are already in them. I do not as the Earth to give me a\nhorse. The craft is in learning to see what it is the Earth chooses to offer.\nPerhaps will be a horse.&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I would like to see your work.&quot; Covenant paid no\nattention to what he was saying. The stairs beckoned him like the seductive\nface of forgetfulness, in which lepers lost their self-protective disciplines,\ntheir hands and feet, their lives.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>But he was dreaming. The way to endure a dream was to flow\nwith it until it ended. He had to make that descent in order to survive. That\nneed outweighed all other considerations.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>Abruptly, convulsively, he hauled himself to his feet.\nPlanting himself squarely in the center of the circle, he ignored the mountain\nand the sky, ignored the long fall below him, and gave himself a thorough\nexamination. Trembling, he probed his still living nerves for aches or twinges,\nscanned his clothing for snags, rents, inspected his numb hands.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>He had to put that stair behind him.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>He could survive it because it was a dream-it could not kill\nhim-and because he could not stand all this darkness beating about his ears.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Now, listen,&quot; he snapped at Lena. &quot;I've got\nto go first. And don't give me that confused look. I told you I'm a leper. My\nhands and feet are numb-no feeling. I can't grip. And I'm-not very good at\nheights. I might fall. I don't want you below me. You-&quot; He balked, then\nwent on roughly, &quot;You've been decent to me, and I haven't had to put up\nwith that for a long time.&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>She winced at his tone. &quot;Why are you angry? How have I\noffended you?&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>By being nice to me! he rasped silently. His face was gray\nwith fear as he turned, dropped to his hands and knees, and backed out through\nthe gap.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>In the first rush of trepidation, he lowered his feet to the\nstairs with his eyes closed. But he could not face the descent without his\neyes; the leper's habit of watching himself, and the need to have all his\nsenses alert, were too strong. Yet with his eyes open the height made his head\nreel. So he strove to keep his gaze on the rock in front of him. From the first\nstep, he knew that his greatest danger lay in the numbness of his feet. Numb\nhands made him feel unsure of every grip, and before he had gone fifty feet he\nwas clenching the edges so hard that his shoulders began to cramp. But he could\nsee his hands, see that they were on the rock, that the aching in his wrists\nand elbows was not a lie. His feet he could not see -not unless he looked down.\nHe could only tell that his foot was on a stair when his ankle felt the\npressure of his weight. In each downward step he lowered himself onto a guess.\nIf he felt an unexpected flex in his arch, he had to catch himself with his\narms and get more of his foot onto the unseen stair. He tried kicking his feet\nforward so that the jar of contact would tell him when his toes were against\nthe edge of the next stair; but when he misjudged, his shins or knees struck\nthe stone corners, and that sharp pain nearly made his legs fold.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>Climbing down stair by stair, staring at his hands with\nsweat streaming into his eyes, he cursed the fate which had cut away two of his\nfingers-two fingers less to save himself with if his feet failed. In addition,</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>the absence of half his hand made him feel that his right\nhold was weaker than his left, that his weight was pulling leftward off the\nstair. He kept reaching his feet to the right to compensate, and kept missing\nthe stairs on that side.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>He could not get the sweat out of his eyes. It stung him\nlike blindness, but he feared to release one hand to wipe his forehead, feared\neven to shake his head because he might lose his balance. Cramps tormented his\nback and shoulders. He had to grit his teeth to keep from crying for help. As\nif she sensed his distress, Lena shouted, &quot;Halfway!&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>He crept on downward, step by step.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>Helplessly, he felt himself moving faster. His muscles were\nfailing-the strain on his knees and elbows was too great and with each step he\nhad less control over his descent. He forced himself to stop and rest, though\nhis terror screamed for him to go on, get the climb over with. For a wild\ninstant, he thought that he would simply turn and leap, hoping he was close\nenough to land on the mountain slope and live. Then he heard the sound of\nLena's feet approaching his head. He wanted to reach up and grab her ankles,\nforce her to save him. But even that hope seemed futile, and he hung where he\nwas, quivering.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>His breath rattled harshly through his clenched teeth, and\nhe almost did not understand Lena's shout: &quot;Thomas Covenant! Be strong!\nOnly fifty steps remain!&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>With a shudder that almost tore him loose from the rock, he\nstarted down again.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>The last steps passed in a loud chaos of cramps and sweat\nblindness-and then he was down, lying flat on the level base of the Watch and\ngasping at the cries of his limbs. For a long time, he covered his face and\nlistened to the air lurching in and out of his lungs like sobs-listened until\nthe sound relaxed and he could breathe more quietly.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>When he finally looked up, he saw the blue sky, the long\nblack finger of Kevin's Watch pointing at the noon sun, the towering slope of\nthe mountain, and Lena bending over him so low that her hair almost brushed his\nface.<br clear=all style='page-break-before:always'>\n</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><a name=\"_Toc370739010\"><span class=Heading1Char><span\nstyle='font-size:16.0pt;line-height:105%'>FIVE: Mithil Stonedown</span></span></a></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>Covenant felt strangely purged, as if he had passed through\nan ordeal, survived a ritual trial by vertigo. He had put the stair behind him.\nIn his relief, he was sure that he had found the right answer to the particular\nthreat of madness, the need for a real and comprehensible explanation to his\nsituation,</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>which had surrounded him on Kevin's Watch. He looked up at\nthe radiant sky, and it appeared pure, untainted by carrion eaters.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>Go forward, he said to himself. Don't think about it.\nSurvive.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>As he thought this, he looked up into Lena's soft brown eyes\nand found that she was smiling. &quot;Are you well?&quot; she asked.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Well?&quot; he echoed. &quot;That's not an easy\nquestion.&quot; It drew him up into a sitting position. Scanning his hands, he\ndiscovered blood on the heels and fingertips. His palms were scraped raw, and\nwhen he probed his knees and shins and elbows they burned painfully.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>Ignoring the ache of his muscles, he pushed to his feet.\n&quot;Lena, this is important,&quot; he said. &quot;I've got to clean my\nhands.&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>She stood also, but he could see that she did not\nunderstand. &quot;Look!&quot; He brandished his hands in front of her. &quot;I'm\na leper. I can't feel this. No pain.&quot; When she still seemed confused, he\nwent on, &quot;That's how I lost my fingers. I got hurt and infected, and they\nhad to cut my hand apart. I've got to get some soap and water.&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>Touching the scar on his right hand, she said, &quot;The\nsickness does this?&quot; &quot;Yes!&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;There is a stream on the way toward the\nStonedown,&quot; said Lena, &quot;and hurtloam near it.&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Let's go.&quot; Brusquely, Covenant motioned for her\nto lead the way. She accepted his urgency with a nod, and started at once down the\npath.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>It went west from the base of Kevin's Watch along a ledge in\nthe steep mountain slope until it reached a cluttered ravine. Moving awkwardly\nbecause of the clenched stiffness of his muscles, Covenant followed Lena up the\nravine, then stepped gingerly behind her down a rough-hewn stair in the side of\na sharp cut which branched away into the mountain. When they reached the bottom\nof the cut, they continued along it, negotiating its scree-littered floor while\nthe slash of sky overhead narrowed and the sides of the cut leaned together. A\nrich, damp smell surrounded them, and the cool shadows deepened until Lena's\ndark tunic became dim in the gloom ahead of Covenant. Then the cut turned\nsharply to the left and opened without warning into a small, sun-bright valley\nwith a stream sparkling through the center and tall pines standing over the\ngrass around the edges.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Here,&quot; said Lena with a happy smile. &quot;What\ncould heal you more than this?&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>Covenant stopped to gaze, entranced, down the length of the\nvalley. It was no more than fifty yards long, and at its far end the stream\nturned left again and filed away between two sheer walls. In this tiny pocket\nin the vastness of the mountain, removed from the overwhelming landscapes below\nKevin's Watch, the earth was comfortably green and sunny, and the air was both\nfresh and warm-pine-aromatic, redolent with springtime. As he breathed the\natmosphere of the place, Covenant felt his chest ache with a familiar grief at\nhis own sickness.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>To ease the pressure in his chest, he moved forward The\ngrass under his feet was so thick and springy that he could feel it through the\nstrained ligaments of his knees and calves. It seemed to encourage him toward\nthe stream, toward the cleansing of his hurts.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>The water was sure to be cold, but that did not concern him.\nHis hands were too numb to notice cold very quickly. Squatting on a flat stone\nbeside the stream, he plunged them into the current and began rubbing them\ntogether. His wrists felt the chill at once, but his fingers were vague about\nthe water; and it gave him no pain to scrub roughly at his cuts and scrapes.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>He was marginally aware that Lena had moved away from him up\nthe stream, apparently looking for something, but he was too preoccupied to\nwonder what she was doing. After an intense scrubbing he let his hands rest,\nand rolled up his sleeves to inspect his elbows. They were red and sore, but\nthe skin was not broken.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>When he pulled up his pant legs, he found that his shins and\nknees were more battered. The discoloration of his bruises was already\ndarkening, and would be practically black before long; but the tough fabric of\nhis trousers had held, and again the skin was unbroken. In their way, bruises\nwere as dangerous to him as cuts, but he could not treat them without medication.\nHe made an effort to stifle his anxiety, and turned his attention back to his\nhands.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>Blood still oozed from the heels and fingertips, and when he\nwashed it off he could see bits of black grit lodged deep in some of the cuts.\nBut before he started washing again, Lena returned. Her cupped hands were full\nof thick brown mud. &quot;This is hurtloam,&quot; she said reverently, as if\nshe were speaking of something rare and powerful. &quot;You must put it on all\nyour wounds.&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Mud?&quot; His leper's caution quivered. &quot;I need\nsoap, not more dirt.&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;This is hurtloam,&quot; repeated Lena. &quot;It is for\nhealing.&quot; She stepped closer and thrust the mud toward him. He thought he\ncould see tiny gleams of gold in it.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>He stared at it blankly, shocked by the idea of putting mud\nin his cuts.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;You must use it,&quot; she insisted. &quot;I know what\nit is. Do you not understand? This is hurtloam. Listen. My father is Trell,\nGravelingas of the rhadhamaerl.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>His work is with the fire-stones, and he leaves healing to\nthe Healers. But he is a rhadhamaerl. He comprehends the rocks and soils. And\nhe taught me to care for myself when there is need. He taught me the signs and\nplaces of hurtloam. This is healing earth. You must use it.&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>Mud? He glared. In my cuts? Do you want to cripple me?</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>Before he could stop her, Lena knelt in front of him and\ndropped a handful of the mud onto his bare knee. With that hand free, she\nspread the brown loam down his shin. Then she scooped up the remainder and put\nit on his other knee and shin. As it lay on his legs, its golden gleaming\nseemed to grow stronger, brighter.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>The wet earth was cool and soothing, and it seemed to stroke\nhis legs tenderly, absorbing the pain from his bruises. He watched it closely.\nThe relief that it sent flowing through his bones gave him a pleasure that he\nhad never felt before. Bemused, he opened his hands to Lena, let her spread\nhurtloam over all his cuts and scrapes.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>At once, the relief began to run up into him through his\nelbows and wrists. And an odd tingling started in his palms, as if the hurtloam\nwere venturing past his cuts into his nerves, trying to reawaken them. A\nsimilar tingling danced across the arches of his feet. He stared at the\nglittering mud with a kind of awe in his eyes.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>It dried quickly; its light vanished into the brown. In a\nfew moments Lena rubbed it off his legs. Then he saw that his bruises were\nalmost gone-they were in the last, faded yellow stages of healing. He slapped\nhis hands into the stream, washed away the mud, looked at his fingers. They had\nbecome whole again. The heels of his hands were healed as well, and the\nabrasions on his forearms had disappeared completely. He was so stunned that\nfor a moment he could only gape at his hands and think, Hellfire. Hellfire and\nbloody damnation. What's happening to me?</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>After a long silence, he whispered, &quot;That's not\npossible.&quot; In response, Lena grinned broadly.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;What's so funny?&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>Trying to imitate his tone, she said, &quot; `I need soap,\nnot more dirt.&quot;' Then she laughed, a teasing sparkle in her eyes.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>But Covenant was too full of surprise to be distracted.\n&quot;I'm serious. How can this happen?&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>Lena dropped her eyes and answered quietly, &quot;There is\npower in the Earth-power and life. You must know this. Atiaran my mother says\nthat such things as hurtloam, such powers and mysteries, are in all the\nEarth-but we are blind to them because we do not share enough, with the Land\nand with each other.&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;There are-other things like this?&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Many. But I know only a few. If you travel to the\nCouncil, it may be that the Lords will teach you everything. But come&quot;-she\nswung lightly to her feet &quot;here is another. Are you hungry?&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>As if cued by her question, an impression of emptiness\nopened in his stomach. How long had it been since he had eaten? He adjusted his\npant legs, rolled down his sleeves, and shrugged himself to his feet. His\nwonder was reinforced to find that almost every ache was gone from his muscles.\nShaking his head in disbelief, he followed Lena toward one side of the valley.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>Under the shade of the trees, she stopped beside a gnarled,\nwaist-high shrub. Its leaves were spread and pointed like a holly's, but it was\nscattered with small viridian blooms, and nestled under some of the leaves were\ntight clusters of a blue-green fruit the size of blueberries.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;This is aliantha,&quot; said Lena. &quot;We call them\ntreasure-berries.&quot; Breaking off a cluster, she ate four or five berries,\nthen dropped the seeds into her hand and threw them behind her. &quot;It is\nsaid that a person can walk the whole length and breadth of the Land eating\nonly. treasure-berries, and return home stronger and better fed than before.\nThey are a great gift of the Earth. They bloom and bear fruit in all seasons.\nThere is no part of the Land in which they do not grow except, perhaps, in the\neast, on the Spoiled Plains. And they are the hardiest of growing things the last\nto die and the first to grow again. All this my mother told me, as part of the\nlore of our people. Eat,&quot; she said, handing Covenant a cluster of the\nberries, &quot;eat, and spread the seeds over the Earth, so that the aliantha\nmay flourish.&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>But Covenant made no move to take the fruit. He was lost in\nwonder, in unanswerable questions about the strange potency of this Land. For\nthe moment, he neglected his danger.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>Lena regarded his unfocused gaze, then took one of the\nberries and put it in his mouth. By reflex, he broke the skin with his teeth;\nat once, his mouth was filled with a light, sweet taste like that of a ripe</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>peach faintly blended with salt and lime. In another moment\nhe was eating greedily, only occasionally remembering to spit out the seeds.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>He ate until he could find no more fruit on that bush, then\nlooked about him for another. But Lena put her hand on his arm to stop him.\n&quot;Treasureberries are strong food,&quot; she said. &quot;You do not need\nmany. And the taste is better if you eat slowly.&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>But Covenant was still hungry. He could not remember ever\nwanting food as much as he now wanted that fruit-the sensations of eating had\nnever been so vivid, so compulsory. He snatched his arm away as if he meant to\nstrike her, then abruptly caught himself.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>What is this? What's happening?</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>Before he could pursue the question, he became aware of\nanother feeling -overpowering drowsiness. In the space of one instant, he\npassed almost without transition from hunger to a huge yawn that made him seem\ntop-heavy with weariness. He tried to turn, and stumbled.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>Lena was saying, &quot;The hurtloam does this, but I did not\nexpect it. When the wounds are very deadly, hurtloam brings sleep to speed the\nhealing. But cuts on the hands are not deadly. Do you have hurts that you did\nnot show me?&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>Yes, he thought through another yawn. I'm sick to death. He\nwas asleep before he hit the grass.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>When he began to drift slowly awake, the first thing that he\nbecame conscious of was Lena's firm thighs pillowing his head. Gradually, he\ngrew aware of other things-the tree shade bedizened with glints of declining\nsunlight, the aroma of pine, the wind murmuring, the grass thickly cradling his\nbody, the sound of a tune, the irregular tingling that came and went from his\npalms like an atavism-but the warmth of his cheek on Lena's lap seemed more\nimportant. For the time, his sole desire was to clasp Lena in his arms and bury\nhis face in her thighs. He resisted it by listening to her song.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>In a soft and somehow naive tone, she sang: Something there\nis in beauty which grows in the soul of the beholder like a flower:</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>fragile- for many are the blights which may waste the beauty\nor the beholder-</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>and imperishable- for the beauty may die, or the beholder\nmay die, or the world may die, but the soul in which the flower grows survives.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>Her voice folded him in a comfortable spell which he did not\nwant to end. After a pause full of the scent of pine and the whispering breeze,\nhe said softly, &quot;I like that.&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Do you? I am glad. It was made by Tomal the\nCraftmaster, for the dance when he wed Imoiran Moiran-daughter. But oft-times\nthe beauty of a song is in the singing, and I am no singer. It may be that\ntonight Atiaran my mother will sing for the Stonedown. Then you will hear a\nreal song.&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>Covenant gave no answer. He lay still, only wishing to\nnestle in his pillow for as long as he could. The tingling in his palms seemed\nto urge him to embrace Lena, and he lay still, enjoying the desire and\nwondering where he would find the courage.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>Then she began to sing again. The tune sounded familiar, and\nbehind it he heard the rumor of dark wings. Suddenly he realized that it was\nvery much like the tune that went with &quot;Golden Boy.&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>He had been walking down the sidewalk toward the offices of\nthe phone company-the Bell Telephone Company; that name was written in gilt\nletters on the door-to pay his bill in person.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>He jerked off Lena's lap, jumped to his-feet. A mist of\nviolence dimmed his vision. &quot;What song is that?&quot; he demanded thickly.\n.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>Startled, Lena answered, &quot;No song. I was only trying to\nmake a melody. Is it wrong?&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>The tone of her voice steadied him-she sounded so abandoned,\nso made forlorn by his quick anger. Words failed him, and the mist passed. No\nbusiness, he thought. I've got no business taking it out on her. Extending his\nhands, he helped her to her feet. He tried to smile, but his stiff face could\nonly grimace. &quot;Where do we go now?&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>Slowly the hurt faded from her eyes. &quot;You are strange,\nThomas Covenant,&quot; she said. Wryly, he replied, &quot;I didn't know it was\nthis bad.&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>For a moment, they stood gazing into each other's eyes. Then\nshe surprised him by blushing and dropping his hands. There was a new\nexcitement in her voice as she said, &quot;We will go to the Stonedown. You\nwill amaze my mother and father.&quot; Gaily, she turned and ran away down the valley.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>She was lithe and light and graceful as she ran, and\nCovenant watched her, musing on the strange new feelings that moved in him. He\nhad an unexpected sense that this Land might offer him some spell with</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>which he could conjure away his impotence, some rebirth to\nwhich he could cling even after he regained consciousness, after the Land and\nall its insane implications faded into the miasma of half-remembered dreams.\nSuch hope did not require that the Land be real, physically actual and\nindependent of his own unconscious, uncontrolled dream-weaving. No, leprosy was\nan incurable disease, and if he did not die from his accident, he would have to\nlive with that fact. But a dream might heal other afflictions. It might. He set\noff after Lena with a swing in his stride and eagerness in his veins.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>The sun was down far enough in the sky to leave the lower\nhalf of the valley in shadow. Ahead of him, he could see Lena beckoning, and he\nfollowed the stream toward her, enjoying the spring of the turf under his feet\nas he walked. He felt somehow taller than before, as if the hurtloam had done\nmore to him than simply heal his cuts and scrapes. Nearing Lena, he seemed to\nsee parts of her for the first time-the delicacy of her ears when her hair\nswung behind them-the way the soft fabric of her shift hung on her breasts and\nhips-her slim waist. The sight of her made the tingling in his palms grow\nstronger.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>She smiled at him, then led the way along the stream and out\nof the valley. They moved down a crooked file between sheer walls of rock which\nclimbed above them until the narrow slit of the sky was hundreds of feet away.\nThe trail was rocky, and Covenant had to watch his feet constantly to keep his\nbalance. The effort made the file seem long, but within a couple hundred yards\nhe and Lena came to a crevice that ascended to the right away from the stream.\nThey climbed into and along the crevice. Soon it leveled, then sloped gradually\ndownward for a long way, but it bent enough so that Covenant could not see\nwhere he was headed.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>At last, the crevice took one more turn and ended, leaving\nLena and Covenant on the mountainside high above the river valley. They were\nfacing due west into the declining sun. The river came out of the mountains to\ntheir left, and flowed away into the plains on their right. There was a branch\nof the mountain range across the valley, but it soon shrank into the plains to\nthe north.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Here is the Mithil,&quot; said Lena. &quot;And there\nis Mithil Stonedown.&quot; Covenant saw a tiny knot of huts north of him on the\neast side of the river. &quot;It is not a great distance,&quot; Lena went on,\n&quot;but the path travels up the valley and then back along the river. The sun\nwill be gone when we reach our Stonedown. Come.&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>Covenant had an uneasy moment looking down the slope of the\nmountain-still more than two thousand feet above the valley-but he mastered it,\nand followed Lena to the south. The mountainside relaxed steadily, and soon the\npath lay along grassy slopes and behind stern rock buttresses, through dells\nand ravines, among mazes of fallen boulders. And as the trail descended, the\nair became deeper, softer, and less crystalline. The smells slowly changed,\ngrew greener; pine and aspen gave way to the loam of the grasslands. Covenant\nfelt that he was alive to every gradation of the change, every nuance of the\nlowering altitude. Through the excitement of his new alertness, the descent\npassed quickly. Before he was ready to leave the mountains, the trail rolled\ndown a long hill, found the river, and then swung north along it.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>The Mithil was narrow and brisk where the path first joined\nit, and it spoke with wet rapidity to itself in a voice full of resonances and\nrumors. But as the river drew toward the plains, it broadened and slowed,\nbecame more philosophical in its low, selfcommuning mutter. Soon its voice no\nlonger filled the air.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>Quietly it told itself its long tale as it rolled away on\nits quest for the sea.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>Under the spell of the river, Covenant became slowly more\nconscious of the reassuring solidity of the Land. It was not an intangible\ndreamscape; it was concrete, susceptible to ascertainment. This was an\nillusion, of course-a trick of his wracked and smitten mind. But it was\ncuriously comforting. It seemed to promise that he was not walking into horror,\nchaos that this Land was coherent, manageable, that when he had mastered its\nlaws, its peculiar facts, he would be able to travel unscathed the path of his\ndream,</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>retain his grip on his sanity. Such thoughts made him feel\nalmost bold as he followed Lena's lithe back, the swaying appeal of her hips:</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>While Covenant wandered in unfamiliar emotions, the Mithil\nvalley dropped into shadow. The sun crossed behind the western mountains, and\nthough light still glowed on the distant plains, a thin veil of darkness\nthickened in the valley. As he watched, the rim of the shadow stretched itself\nhigh up the mountain on his right, climbing like a hungry tide the shores of\nday. In the twilight, he sensed his peril sneaking furtively closer to him,\nthough he did not know what it was.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>Then the last ridge of the mountains fell into dusk, and the\nglow on the plains began to fade. Lena stopped, touched Covenant's arm,\npointed. &quot;See,&quot; she said, &quot;here is Mithil Stonedown.&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>They stood atop a long, slow hill, and at its bottom were\ngathered the buildings of the village. Covenant could see the houses quite\nclearly, although lights already shone faintly behind some of the windows.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>Except for a large, open circle in the center of the\nvillage, the Stonedown looked as erratically laid out as if it had fallen off\nthe mountain not long ago. But this impression was belied by the smooth sheen\nof the stone walls and the fiat roofs. And when he looked more closely,\nCovenant saw that the Stonedown was not in fact unorganized. All the buildings\nfaced in toward the center.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>None of them had more than one story, and all were stone,\nwith fiat slabs of rock for roofs; but they varied considerably in size and\nshape-some were round, others square or rectangular, and still others so\nirregular from top to bottom that they seemed more like squat hollow boulders\nthan buildings.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>As she and Covenant started down toward the Stonedown, Lena\nsaid, &quot;Five times a hundred people of the South Plains live\nhere-rhadhamaerl, Shepherds, Cattleherds, Farmers, and those who Craft. But\nAtiaran my mother alone has been to the Loresraat.&quot; Pointing, she added,\n&quot;The home of my family is there-nearest the river.&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>Walking together, she and Covenant skirted the Stonedown\ntoward her home.<br clear=all style='page-break-before:always'>\n</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><a name=\"_Toc370739011\"><span class=Heading1Char><span\nstyle='font-size:16.0pt;line-height:105%'>SIX: Legend of Berek Halfhand</span></span></a></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>Dusk was deepening over the valley. Birds gathered to rest\nfor the night in the trees of the foothills. They sang and called energetically\nto each other for a while, but their high din soon relaxed into a quiet,\nsatisfied murmur. As Lena and Covenant passed behind the outer houses of the\nStonedown, they could again hear the river contemplating itself in the\ndistance. Lena was silent, as if she were containing some excitement or\nagitation, and Covenant was too immersed in the twilit sounds around him to say\nanything. The swelling night seemed full of soft communions-anodynes for the\nloneliness of the dark. So they came quietly toward Lena's home.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>It was a rectangular building, larger than most in the\nStonedown, but with the same polished sheen on the walls. A warm yellow light\nradiated from the windows. As Lena and Covenant approached, a large figure\ncrossed one of the windows and moved toward a farther room.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>At the corner of the house, Lena paused to take Covenant's\nhand and squeezed it before she led him up to the doorway.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>The entry was covered with a heavy curtain. She held it\naside and drew him into the house. There she halted. Looking around swiftly, he\nobserved that the room they had entered went the depth of the house, but it had\ntwo curtained doors in either wall. In it, a stone table and benches with\nenough space to seat six or eight people occupied the middle of the floor. But\nthe room was large enough so that the table did not dominate it.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>Cut into the rock walls all around the room were shelves,\nand these were full of stoneware jars and utensils, some obviously for use in\ncooking and eating, others with functions which Covenant could not guess.\nSeveral rock stools stood against the walls. And the warm yellow light filled\nthe chamber, glowing on the smooth surfaces and reflecting off rare colors and\ntextures in the stone.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>The light came from fires in several stone pots, one in each\ncorner of the room and one in the center of the table; but there was no flicker\nof flames-the light was as steady as its stone containers. And with the light\ncame a soft smell as of newly broken earth.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>After only a cursory glance around the chamber; Covenant's\nattention was drawn to the far end of the room. There on a slab of stone\nagainst the wall sat a huge granite pot, half as tall as a man. And over the\npot, peering intently at its contents, stood a large man, a great pillar of a\nfigure, as solid as a boulder. He had his back to Lena and Covenant, and did\nnot seem to be aware of them. He wore a short brown tunic with brown trousers\nunder it, but the leaf pattern woven into the fabric at his shoulders was\nidentical to Lena's. Under the tunic, his massive muscles bunched and stretched\nas he rotated the pot. It looked prodigiously heavy, but Covenant half expected\nthe man to lift it over his head to pour out its contents.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>There was a shadow over the pot which the brightness of the\nroom did not penetrate, and for some time the man stared into the darkness,\nstudying it while he rotated the pot. Then he began to sing. His voice was too\nlow for Covenant to make out the words, but as he listened he felt a kind of\ninvocation in the sound, as if the contents of the pot were powerful. For a\nmoment, nothing happened. Then the shadow began to pale. At first, Covenant\nthought that the light in the room had changed, but soon be saw a new illumination\nstarting from the pot. The glow swelled and deepened, and at last shone out\nstrongly, making the other lights seem thin.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>With a final mutter over his work, the man stood upright and\nturned around. In the new brightness, he seemed even taller and broader than\nbefore, as if his limbs and shoulders and deep chest drew strength, stature,\nfrom the light; and his forehead was ruddy from the heat of the pot. Seeing\nCovenant, he started in surprise. An uneasy look came into his eyes, and his\nright hand touched his thick reddish beard. Then he extended the hand, palm\nforward, toward Covenant, and said to Lena, &quot;Well, daughter, you bring a\nguest. But I remember that our hospitality is in your charge today.&quot; The\nstrange potency of a moment before was gone from his voice. He sounded like a\nman who did not speak much with people. But though he was treating his daughter\nsternly, he seemed essentially calm. &quot;You know I promised more graveling\ntoday, and Atiaran your mother is helping deliver the new child of Odona\nMurrin-mate. The guest will be offended by our hospitality-with no meal ready\nto welcome the end of his day.&quot; Yet while he reprimanded Lena, his eyes\nstudied Covenant cautiously.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>Lena bowed her head, trying, Covenant felt sure, to look\nashamed for her father's benefit. But a moment later she hurried across the\nroom and hugged the big man. He smiled softly at her upturned face. Then,\nturning toward Covenant, she announced, &quot;Trell my father, I bring a\nstranger to the Stonedown. I found him on Kevin's Watch.&quot; A lively gleam\nshone in her eyes, although she tried to keep her voice formal.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;So,&quot; Trell responded. &quot;A stranger-that I\nsee. And wonder what business took him to that ill-blown place.&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;He fought with a gray cloud,&quot; answered Lena.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>Looking at this bluff, hale man, whose muscle knotted arm\nrested with such firm gentleness on Lena's shoulder, Covenant expected him to\nlaugh at the absurd suggestion-a man fighting a cloud. Trell's presence felt\nimperturbable and earthy, like an assertion of common sense that reduced the\nnightmare of Foul to its proper unreality. So Covenant was put off his balance\nby hearing Trell ask with perfect seriousness, &quot;Which was the\nvictor?&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>The question forced Covenant to find a new footing for\nhimself. He was not prepared to deal with the memory of Lord Foul-but at the\nsame time he felt obscurely sure that he could not lie to Trell. He found that\nhis throat had gone dry, and he answered awkwardly, &quot;I lived through\nit.&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>Trell said nothing for a moment, but in the silence Covenant\nfelt that his answer had increased the big man's uneasiness. Trell's eyes\nshifted away, then came back as he said, &quot;I see. And what is your name,\nstranger?&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>Promptly, Lena smiled at Covenant and answered for him,\n&quot;Thomas Covenant. Covenant of Kevin's Watch.&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;What, girl?&quot; asked Trell. &quot;Are you a\nprophet, that you speak for someone higher than you?&quot; Then to Covenant he\nsaid, &quot;Well, Thomas Covenant of Kevin's Watch-do you have other\nnames?&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>Covenant was about to respond negatively when he caught an\neager interest in the question from Lena's eyes. He paused. In a leap of\ninsight, he realized that he was as exciting to her as if he had in fact been\nBerek Halfhand-that to her yearning toward mysteries and powers, all-knowing\nLords and battles in the clouds, his strangeness and his unexplained appearance\non the Watch made him seem like a personification of great events out of a\nheroic past. The message of her gaze was suddenly plain; in the suspense of her\ncuriosity she was hanging from the hope that he would reveal himself to her,\ngive her some glimpse of his high calling to appease her for her youth and\nignorance.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>The idea filled him with strange reverberations. He was not\nused to such flattery; it gave him an unfamiliar sense of possibility. Quickly,\nhe searched for some high-sounding title to give himself, some name by which he\ncould please Lena without falsifying himself to Trell. Then he had an\ninspiration. &quot;Thomas Covenant,&quot; he said as if he were rising to a\nchallenge, &quot;the Unbeliever.&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>Immediately, he felt that with that name he had committed\nhimself to more than he could measure at present. The act made him feel\npretentious, but Lena rewarded him with a beaming glance, and Trell accepted\nthe statement gravely. &quot;Well, Thomas Covenant,&quot; he replied, &quot;you\nare welcome to Mithil Stonedown. Please accept the hospitality of this home. I\nmust go now to take my graveling as I promised. It may be that Atiaran my wife\nwill return soon. And if you prod her, Lena may remember to offer you\nrefreshment while I am gone.&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>While he spoke, Trell turned back to his stone pot. He\nwrapped his arms about it, lifted it from its base. With red-gold flames\nreflecting a dance in his hair and beard, he carried the pot toward the\ndoorway.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>Lena hurried ahead of him to hold open the curtain, and in a\nmoment Trell was gone, leaving Covenant with one glimpse of the contents of the\npot. It was full of small, round stones like fine gravel, and they seemed to be\non fire.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Damnation,&quot; Covenant whispered. &quot;How heavy\nis that thing?&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Three men cannot lift the pot alone,&quot; replied\nLena proudly. &quot;But when the graveling burns, my father may lift it easily.\nHe is a Gravelingas of the rhadhamaerl, deep with the lore of stone.&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>Covenant stared after him for a moment, appalled by Trell's\nstrength.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>Then Lena said, &quot;Now, I must not fail to offer you\nrefreshment. Will you wash or bathe? Are you thirsty? We have good\nspringwine.&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>Her voice brought back the scintillation of Covenant's\nnerves. His instinctive distrust of Trell's might dissipated under the\nrealization that he had a power of his own. This world accepted him; it\naccorded him importance. People like Trell and Lena were prepared to take him\nas seriously as he wanted. All he had to do was keep moving, follow the path of\nhis dream to Revelstone-whatever that was. He felt giddy at the prospect. On\nthe impetus of the moment, he determined to participate in his own importance,.\nenjoy it while it lasted.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>To cover his rush of new emotions, he told Lena that he\nwould like to wash. She took him past a curtain into another room, where water\npoured continuously from a spout in the wall. A sliding stone valve sent the\nwater into either a washbasin or a large tub, both formed of stone. Lena showed\nhim some fine sand to use as soap, then left him. The water was cold, but he\nplunged his hands and head into it with something approaching enthusiasm.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>When he was done, he looked around for a towel, but did not\nsee one. Experimentally, he eased a hand over the glowing pot that lit the\nroom. The warm yellow light dried his fingers rapidly, so he leaned over the\npot, rubbing the water from his face and neck, and soon even his hair was dry.\nBy force of habit, he went through his VSE, examining the nearly invisible\nmarks where his hands had been cut. Then he pushed the curtain out of his way\nand reentered the central chamber.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>He found that another woman had joined Lena. As he returned,\nhe heard Lena say, &quot;He says he knows nothing of us.&quot; Then the other\nwoman looked at him, and he guessed immediately that she was Atiaran. The leaf\npattern at the shoulders of her long brown robe seemed to be a kind of family\nemblem; he did not need such hints to see the long familiarity in the way the\nolder woman touched Lena's shoulder, or the similarities in their posture. But\nwhere Lena was fresh and slim of line, full of unbroken newness, Atiaran\nappeared complex, almost self-contradictory. Her soft surface, her full figure,\nshe carried as if it were a hindrance to the hard strength of experience within\nher, as if she lived with her body on the basis of an old and difficult truce.\nAnd her face bore the signs of that truce; her forehead seemed prematurely\nlined, and her deep spacious eyes appeared to open inward on a weary\nbattleground of doubts and uneasy reconciliations. Looking at her over the\nstone table, Covenant received a double impression of a frowning concern-the\nresult of knowing and fearing more than other people realized-and an absent\nbeauty that would rekindle her face if only she would smile.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>After a brief hesitation, the older woman touched her heart\nand raised her hand toward Covenant as Trell had done. &quot;Hail, guest, and\nwelcome. I am Atiaran Trell-mate. I have spoken with Trell, and with Lena my\ndaughter-you need no introduction to me, Thomas Covenant. Be comfortable in our\nhome.&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>Remembering his manners-and his new determination-Covenant\nresponded, &quot;I'm honored.&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>Atiaran bowed slightly. &quot;Accepting that which is\noffered honors the giver. And courtesy is always welcome.&quot; Then she seemed\nto hesitate again, uncertain of how to proceed. Covenant watched the return of\nold conflicts to her eyes, thinking that gaze would have an extraordinary power\nif it were not- so inward. But she reached her decision soon, and said,\n&quot;It is not the custom of our people to worry a guest with hard questions before\neating. But the food is not ready &quot;she glanced at Lena-&quot; and you are\nstrange to me, Thomas Covenant, strange and disquieting. I would talk with you\nif I may, while Lena prepares what food we have. You seem to bear a need that\nshould not wait.&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>Covenant shrugged noncommittally. He felt a twinge of\nanxiety at the thought of her questions, and braced himself to try to answer\nthem without losing his new balance.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>In the pause, Lena began moving around the room. She went to\nthe shelves to get plates and bowls for the table, and prepared some dishes on\na slab of stone heated from underneath by a tray of graveling. She turned her\neyes toward Covenant often as she moved, but he did not always notice. Atiaran\ncompelled his attention.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>At first, she murmured uncertainly, &quot;I hardly know\nwhere to begin. It has been so long, and I learned so little of what the Lords\nknow. But what I have must be enough. No one here can take my place.&quot; She\nstraightened her shoulders. &quot;May I see your hands?&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>Remembering Lena's initial reaction to him, Covenant held up\nhis right hand.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>Atiaran moved around the table until she was close enough to\ntouch him, but did not. Instead, she searched his face. &quot;Halfhand. It is\nas Trell said. And some say that Berek Earthfriend, Heartthew and Lord\nFatherer, will return to the Land when there is need. Do you know these\nthings?&quot; Covenant answered gruffly, &quot;No.&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>Still looking into his face, Atiaran said, &quot;Your other\nhand?&quot; Puzzled, he raised his left. She dropped her eyes to it.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>When she saw it, she gasped, and bit her lip and stepped\nback. For an instant, she seemed inexplicably terrified. But she mastered\nherself, and asked with only a low tremble in her voice, &quot;What metal is\nthat ring?&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;What? This?&quot; Her reaction startled Covenant, and\nin his surprise he gaped at a complicated memory of Joan saying, With this ring\nI thee wed, and the old ocher-robed beggar replying, Be true, be true. Darkness\nthreatened him. He heard himself answer as if he were someone else, someone who\nhad nothing to do with leprosy and divorce, &quot;It's white gold.&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>Atiaran groaned, clamped her hands over her temples as if\nshe were in pain. But again she brought herself under control, and a bleak\ncourage came into her eyes. &quot;I alone,&quot; she said, &quot;I alone in\nMithil Stonedown know the meaning of this. Even Trell has not this knowledge.\nAnd I know too little. Answer, Thomas Covenant-is it true?&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>I should've thrown it away, he muttered bitterly. A leper's\ngot no right to be sentimental.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>But Atiaran's intensity drew his attention toward her again.\nShe gave him the impression that she knew more about what was happening to him\nthan he did that he was moving into a world which, in some dim, ominous way,\nhad been made ready for him. His old anger mounted. &quot;Of course it's\ntrue,&quot; he snapped.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;What's the matter with you? It's only a ring.&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;It is white gold.&quot; Atiaran's reply sounded as\nforlorn as if she had just suffered a bereavement.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;So what?&quot; He could not understand what distressed\nthe woman. &quot;It doesn't mean a thing. Joan-&quot; Joan had preferred it to\nyellow gold. But that had not prevented her from divorcing him.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;It is white gold,&quot; Atiaran repeated. &quot;The\nLords sing an ancient lore-song concerning the bearer of white gold. I remember\nonly a part of it, thus:</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>And he who wields white wild magic gold is a paradox- for he\nis everything and nothing, hero and fool, potent, helpless- and with the one\nword of truth or treachery, he will save or damn the Earth because he is mad\nand sane, cold and passionate, lost and found.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>Do you know the song, Covenant? There is no white gold in\nthe Land. Gold has never been found in the Earth, though it is said that Berek\nknew of it, and made the songs. You come from another place. What terrible\npurpose brings you here?&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>Covenant felt her searching him with her eyes for some flaw,\nsome falsehood which would give the lie to her fear. He stiffened. You have\nmight, the Despiser had said, wild magic- You will never know what it is. The\nidea that his wedding band was some kind of talisman nauseated him like the\nsmell of attar. He had a savage desire to shout. None of this is happening! But\nhe only knew of one workable response: don't think about it, follow the path,\nsurvive. He met Atiaran on her own ground. &quot;All purposes are terrible. I\nhave a message for the Council of Lords.&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;What message?&quot; she demanded.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>After only an instant's hesitation, he grated, &quot;The\nGray Slayer has come back.&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>When she heard Covenant pronounce that name, Lena dropped\nthe stoneware bowl she was carrying,</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>and fled into her mother's arms.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>Covenant stood glowering at the shattered bowl. The liquid\nit had contained gleamed on the smooth stone floor. Then he heard Atiaran pant\nin horror, &quot;How do you know this?&quot; He looked back at her, and saw the\ntwo women clinging together like children threatened by the demon of their worst\ndreams. Leper outcast unclean! he thought sourly. But as he watched, Atiaran\nseemed to grow solider. Her jaw squared, her broad glance hardened. For all her\nfear, she was a strong woman comforting her child-and bracing herself to meet\nher danger. Again she asked, &quot;How do you know?&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>She made him feel defensive, and he replied, &quot;I met him\non Kevin's Watch.&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Ali, alas!&quot; she cried, hugging Lena. &quot;Alas\nfor the young in this world! The doom of the Land is upon them. Generations\nwill die in agony, and there will be war and terror and pain for those who\nlive! Alas, Lena my daughter. You were born into an evil time, and there will\nbe no peace or comfort for you when the battle comes. Ali, Lena, Lena.&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>Her grief touched an undefended spot in Covenant, and his throat\nthickened. Her voice filled his own image of the Land's Desolation with a\nthrenody he had not heard before. For the first time, he sensed that the Land\nheld something precious which was in danger of being lost.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>This combination of sympathy and anger tightened his nerves\nstill further. He vibrated to a sharper pitch, trembled. When he looked at\nLena, he saw that a new awe of him had already risen above her panic. The\nunconscious offer in her eyes burned more disturbingly than ever.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>He held himself still until Atiaran and Lena slowly released\neach other. Then he asked, &quot;What do you know about all this? About what's\nhappening to me?&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>Before Atiaran could reply, a voice called from outside the\nhouse, &quot;Hail! Atiaran Tiaran-daughter. Trell Gravelingas tells us that\nyour work is done for this day. Come and sing to the Stonedown!&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>For a moment, Atiaran stood still, shrinking back into\nherself. Then she sighed, &quot;Ali, the work of my life has just begun,&quot;\nand turned to the door. Holding aside the curtain, she said into the night,\n&quot;We have not yet eaten. I will come later. But after the gathering I must\nspeak with the Circle of elders.&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;They will be told,&quot; the voice answered.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Good,&quot; said Atiaran. But instead of returning to\nCovenant, she remained in the doorway, staring into the darkness for a while.\nWhen she closed the curtain at last and faced Covenant, her eyes were moist,\nand they held a look that he at first thought was defeat. But then he realized\nthat she was only remembering defeat. &quot;No, Thomas Covenant,&quot; she said\nsadly, &quot;I know nothing of your fate. Perhaps if I had remained at the\nLoresraat longer-if I had had the strength. But I passed my limit there, and\ncame home. I know a part of the old Lore that Mithil Stonedown does not guess,\nbut it is too little. All that I can remember for you are hints of a wild magic\nwhich destroys peace wild magic graven in every rock, contained for white gold\nto unleash or control but the meaning of such lines, or the courses of these\ntimes, I do not know. That is a double reason to take you to the Council.&quot;\nThen she looked squarely into his face, and added, &quot;I tell you openly,\nThomas Covenant-if you have come to betray the Land, only the Lords may hope to\nstop you.&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>Betray? This was another new thought. An instant passed\nbefore he realized what Atiaran was suggesting. But before he could protest,\nLena put in for him, &quot;Mother! He fought a gray cloud on Kevin's</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>Watch. I saw it. How can you doubt him?&quot; Her defense\ncontrolled his belligerent reaction. Without intending to, she had put him on\nfalse ground. He had not gone so far as to fight Lord Foul.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>Trell's return stopped any reply Atiaran might have made.\nThe big man stood in the doorway for a moment, looking between Atiaran and Lena\nand Covenant. Abruptly, he said, &quot;So. We are come on hard times.&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Yes, Trell my husband,&quot; murmured Atiaran.\n&quot;Hard times.&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>Then his eyes caught the shards of stoneware on the floor.\n&quot;Hard times, indeed,&quot; he chided gently, &quot;when stoneware is\nbroken, and the pieces left to powder underfoot.&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>This time, Lena was genuinely ashamed. &quot;I am sorry,\nFather,&quot; she said. &quot;I was afraid.&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;No matter.&quot; Trell went to her and placed his big\nhands, light with affection, on her shoulders. &quot;Some wounds may be healed.\nI feel strong today.&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>At this, Atiaran gazed gratefully at Trell as if he had just\nundertaken some heroic task.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>To Covenant's incomprehension, she said, &quot;Be seated,\nguest. Food will be ready soon. Come, Lena.&quot; The two of them began to\nbustle around the cooking stone.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>Covenant watched as Trell started to pick up the pieces of\nthe broken pot. The Gravelingas' voice rumbled softly, singing an ancient\nsubterranean song. Tenderly, he carried the shards to the table and set them\ndown near the lamp. Then he seated himself. Covenant sat beside him, wondering\nwhat was about to happen.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>Singing his cavernous song between clenched teeth, Trell\nbegan to fit the shards together as if the pot were a puzzle. Piece after piece\nhe set in place, and each piece held where he left it without any adhesive\nCovenant could see. Trell moved painstakingly, his touch delicate on every\nfragment, but the pot seemed to grow quickly in his hands, and the pieces fit\ntogether perfectly, leaving only a network of fine black lines to mark the\nbreaks. Soon all the shards were in place.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>Then his deep tone took on a new cadence. He began to stroke\nthe stoneware with his fingers, and everywhere his touch passed, the black\nfracturemarks vanished as if they had been erased. Slowly, he covered every\ninch of the pot with his caress. When he had completed the outside, he stroked\nthe inner surface. And finally he lifted the pot, spread his touch over its\nbase. Holding the pot between the fingers of both hands, he rotated it\ncarefully, making sure he had missed nothing. Then he stopped singing, set the\npot down gently, took his hands away. It was as complete and solid as if it had\nnever been dropped.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>Covenant pulled his awed stare away from the pot to Trell's\nface. The Gravelingas looked haggard with strain, and his taut cheeks were\nstreaked with tears. &quot;Mending is harder than breaking,&quot; he mumbled.\n&quot;I could not do this every day.&quot; Wearily, he folded his arms on the\ntable and cradled his head in them.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>Atiaran stood behind her husband, massaging the heavy\nmuscles of his shoulders and neck, and her eyes were full of pride and love.\nSomething in her expression made Covenant feel that he came from a very poor\nworld, where no one knew or cared about healing stoneware pots. He tried to\ntell himself that he was dreaming, but he did not want to listen.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>After a silent pause full of respect for Trell's deed, Lena\nstarted to set the table. Soon Atiaran brought bowls of food from the cooking\nstone. When everything was ready, Trell lifted his head, climbed tiredly</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>to his feet. With Atiaran and Lena, he stood beside the\ntable. Atiaran said to Covenant, &quot;It is the custom of our people to stand\nbefore eating, as a sign of our respect for the Earth, from which life and food\nand power come.&quot; Covenant stood as well, feeling awkward and out of place.\nTrell and Atiaran and Lena closed their eyes, bowed their heads for a moment.\nThen they sat down. When Covenant had followed them to the bench, they began to\npass around the food.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>It was a bountiful meal: there was cold salt beef covered\nwith a steaming gravy, wild rice, dried apples, brown bread, and cheese; and\nCovenant was given a tall mug of a drink which Lena called springwine. This\nbeverage was as clear and light as water, slightly effervescent, and it smelled\ndimly of aliantha; but it tasted like a fine beer which had been cured of all bitterness.\nCovenant had downed a fair amount of it before he realized that it added a\nstill keener vibration to his already thrumming nerves. He could feel himself\ntightening. He was too full of unusual pressures. Soon he was impatient for the\nend of the meal, impatient to leave the house and expand in the night air.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>But Lena's family ate slowly, and a pall hung over them.\nThey dined as deliberately as if this meal marked the end of all their\nhappiness together. In the silence, Covenant realized that this was a result of\nhis presence. It made him uneasy.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>To ease himself, he tried to increase what he knew about his\nsituation. &quot;I have a question,&quot; he said stiffly. With a gesture, he\ntook in the whole Stonedown. &quot;No wood. There's plenty of trees all over\nthis valley,</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>but I don't see you using any wood. Are the trees sacred or\nsomething?&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>After a moment, Atiaran replied, &quot;Sacred? I know that\nword, but its meaning is obscure to me. There is Power in the Earth, in trees\nand rivers and soil and stone, and we respect it for the life it gives. So we\nhave sworn the Oath of Peace. Is that what you ask? We do not use wood because\nthe wood-lore, the lillianrill, is lost to us, and we have not sought to regain\nit. In the exile of our people, when Desolation was upon the Land, many\nprecious things were lost. Our people clung to the rhadhamaerl lore in the\nSouthron Range and the Wastes, and it enabled us to endure. The wood-lore\nseemed not to help us, and it was forgotten. Now that we have returned to the\nLand, the stone-lore suffices for us. But others have kept the lillianrill. I\nhave seen Soaring Woodhelven, in the hills far north and east of us, and it is\na fair place-their people understand wood, and flourish. There is some trade\nbetween Stonedown and Woodhelven, but wood and stone are not traded.&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>When she stopped, Covenant sensed a difference in the new\nsilence. A moment passed before he was sure that he could hear a distant rumor\nof voices. Shortly, Atiaran confirmed this by saying to Trell, &quot;Ali, the\ngathering. I promised to sing tonight.&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>She and Trell stood together, and he said, &quot;So. And\nthen you will speak with the Circle of elders. Some preparations for tomorrow I\nwill make. &quot;See&quot; he pointed at the table-&quot;it will be a fine day\n-there is no shadow on the heart of the stone.&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>Almost in spite of himself, Covenant looked where Trell\npointed. But he could see nothing.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>Noticing his blank look, Atiaran said kindly, &quot;Do not\nbe surprised, Thomas Covenant. No one but a rhadhamaerl can foretell weather in\nsuch stones as this. Now come with me, if you will, and I will sing the legend\nof Berek Halfhand.&quot; As she spoke, she took the pot of graveling from the\ntable to carry with her. &quot;Lena, will you clean the stoneware?&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>Covenant, got to his feet. Glancing at Lena, he saw her face\ntwisted with unhappy obedience; she</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>clearly wanted to go with them. But Trell also saw her\nexpression and said, &quot;Accompany our guest, Lena my daughter. I will not be\ntoo busy to care for the stoneware.&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>Pleasure transformed her instantly, and she leaped up to\nthrow her arms around her father's neck. He returned her embrace for a moment,\nthen lowered her to the floor. She straightened her shift, trying to look\nsuddenly demure, and moved to her mother's side.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>Atiaran said, &quot;Trell, you will teach this girl to think\nshe is a queen.&quot; But she took Lena's hand to show that she was not angry,\nand together they went past the curtain. Covenant followed promptly, went out\nof the house into the starry night with a sense of release. There was more room\nfor him to explore himself under the open sky.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>He needed exploration. He could not understand, rationalize,\nhis mounting excitement. The springwine he had consumed seemed to provide a\nfocus for his energies; it capered in his veins like a raving satyr. He felt\ninexplicably brutalized by inspiration, as if he were the victim rather than\nthe source of his dream. White gold! he sputtered at the darkness between the\nhouses. Wild magic! Do they think I'm crazy?</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>Perhaps he was crazy. Perhaps he was at this moment\nwandering in dementia, tormenting himself with false griefs and demands, the\nimpositions of an illusion. Such things had happened to lepers.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>I'm not! he shouted, almost cried out aloud. I know the\ndifference-I know I'm dreaming.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>His fingers twitched with violence, but he drew cool air\ndeep into his lungs, put everything behind him. He knew how to survive a dream.\nMadness was the only danger.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>As they walked together between the houses, Lena's smooth\narm brushed his. His skin felt lambent at the touch.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>The murmur of people grew quickly louder. Soon Lena,\nAtiaran, and Covenant reached the circle, moved into the gathering of the\nStonedown.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>It was lit by dozens of hand-held graveling pots, and in the\nillumination Covenant could see clearly. Men, women, and children clustered the\nrim of the circle. Covenant guessed that virtually the entire Stonedown had\ncome to hear Atiaran sing. Most of the people were shorter than he was-and\nconsiderably shorter than Trell-and they had dark hair, brown or black, again\nunlike Trell. But they were a stocky, broad-shouldered breed, and even the\nwomen and children gave an impression of physical strength; centuries of\nstone-work had shaped them to suit their labor. Covenant felt the same dim fear\nof them that he had of Trell. They seemed too strong, and he had nothing but\nhis strangeness to protect him if they turned against him.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>They were busy talking to each other, apparently waiting for\nAtiaran, and they gave no sign of noticing Covenant. Reluctant to call\nattention to himself, he hung back at the outer edges of the gathering. Lena\nstopped with him. Atiaran gave her the graveling pot, then moved away through\nthe crowd toward the center of the circle.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>After he had scanned the assembly, Covenant turned his\nattention to Lena. She stood by his right side, the top of her head just an\ninch or two higher than his shoulder, and she held the graveling pot at her\nwaist with both hands, so that the light emphasized her breasts. She was\nclearly unconscious of the effect, but he felt it intensely, and his palms itched\nagain with an eager and fearful desire to touch her.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>As if she felt his thoughts, she looked up at him with a\nsolemn softness in her face that made his heart</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>lurch as if it were too big for his constraining ribs.\nAwkwardly, he took his eyes away, stared around the circle without seeing\nanything. When he glanced back at her, she seemed to be doing just what he had\ndone-pretending to look elsewhere. He tightened his jaw and forced himself to\nwait for something to happen.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>Soon the gathering became still. In the center of the open\ncircle, Atiaran stood up on a low stone platform. She bowed her head to the\ngathering, and the people responded by silently raising their graveling pots.\nThe lights seemed to focus around her like a penumbra.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>When the pots were lowered, and a last ripple of shuffling\nhad passed through the gathering, Atiaran began: &quot;I feel I am an old woman\nthis night -my memory seems clouded, and I do not remember all the song I would\nlike to sing. But what I remember I will sing, and I will tell you the story,\nas I have told it before, so that you may share what lore I have.&quot; At\nthis, low laughter ran through the gathering-a humorous tribute to Atiaran's\nsuperior knowledge. She remained silent, her head bowed to hide the fear that\nknowledge had brought her, until the people were quiet again. Then she raised\nher eyes and said, &quot;I will sing the legend of Berek Halfhand.&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>After a last momentary pause, she placed her song into the\nwelcoming silence like a rough and rare jewel.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>In war men pass like shadows that stain the grass,</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>Leaving their lives upon the green: While Earth bewails the\ncrimson sheen,</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>Men's dreams and stars and whispers all helpless pass. In\none red shadow by woe and wicked cast,</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>In one red pool about his feet, Derek mows the vile like ripe\nwheat, Though of all of Beauty's guarders he is last: Last to pass into the\nshadow of defeat, And last to feel the full despair, And leave his weapons\nlying there Take his half unhanded hand from battle seat. Across the plains of\nthe Land they all swept Treachers lust at faltering stridAes Berek fled before\nthe tide, Till on Mount Thunder's rock-mantled side he wept.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>Berek! Earthfriend!-Help and weal,</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>Battle-aid against the foe! Earth gives and answers Power's\npeal, Ringing, Earthfriend! Help and heal!</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>Clean the Land from bloody death and woe!</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>The song made Covenant quiver, as if it concealed a specter\nwhich he should have been able to recognize. But Atiaran's voice enthralled\nhim. No instruments aided her singing, but before she had finished her first line,\nhe knew that she did not need them. The clean thread of her melody was\ntapestried with unexpected resonances, implied harmonies, echoes of silent\nvoices, so that on every rising motif she seemed about to expand into three or\nfour singers, throats separate and unanimous in the song.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>It began in a minor mode that made the gold-hued,\nstar-gemmed night throb like a dirge; and through it blew a black wind of loss,\nin which things cherished and consecrated throughout the Stonedown seemed to\nflicker and go out. As he listened, Covenant felt that the entire gathering\nwept with the song, cried out as one in silent woe under the wide power of the\nsinger.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>But grief did not remain long in that voice. After a pause\nthat opened in the night like a revelation, Atiaran broke into her brave\nrefrain-&quot;Berek! Earthfriend!'--and the change carried her high in a major\nmodulation that would have been too wrench ing for any voice less rampant with\nsuggestions, less thickly woven, than hers. The emotion of the gathering continued,\nbut it was reborn in an instant from grief to joy and gratitude. And as\nAtiaran's long, last high note sprang from her throat like a salute to the\nmountains and the stars, the people held up their graveling pots and gave a\nresounding shout:</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Berek! Earthfriend! Hail!&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>Then, slowly, they lowered their lights and began to press\nforward, moving closer to Atiaran to hear her story. The common impulse was so\nsimple and strong that Covenant took a few steps as well before he could\nrecollect himself. Abruptly, he looked about him-focused his eyes on the faint\nglimmering stars, smelled the pervasive, aroma of the graveling. The unanimous\nreaction of the Stonedown frightened him;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>he could not afford to lose himself in it. He wanted to turn\naway, but he needed to hear Berek's story, so he stayed where he was.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>As soon as the people had settled themselves, Atiaran began.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;It came to pass that there was a great war in the\neldest days, in the age that marks the beginning of the memory of\nmankind-before the Old Lords were born, before the Giants came across the\nSunbirth Sea to make the alliance of Rockbrothers-a time before the Oath of\nPeace, before the Desolation and High Lord Kevin's last battle. It was a time\nwhen the Viles who sired the Demondim were a high and lofty race, and the\nCavewights smithed and smelted beautiful metals to trade in open friendship\nwith all the people of the Land. In that time, the Land was one great nation,\nand over it ruled a King and Queen. They were a hale pair, rich with love and\nhonor, and for many years they held their sway in unison and peace.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;But after a time a shadow came over the heart of the\nKing. He tasted the power of life and death over those who served him, and\nlearned to desire it. Soon mastery became a lust with him, as necessary as\nfood. His nights were spent in dark quests for more power, and by day he\nexercised that power,</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>becoming hungrier and more cruel as the lust overcame him.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;But the Queen looked on her husband and was dismayed.\nShe desired only that the health and fealty of the past years should return.\nBut no appeal, no suasion or power of hers, could break the grip of cruelty\nthat degraded the King. And at last, when she saw that the good of the Land\nwould surely die if her husband were not halted, she broke with him, opposed\nhis might with hers.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Then there was war in the Land. Many who had felt the\ncut of the King's lash stood with the Queen. And many who hated murder and\nloved life joined her also. The chiefest of these was Berek-strongest and\nwisest of the Queen's champions. But the fear of the King was upon the Land,\nand whole cities rose up to fight for him, killing to protect their own\nslavery.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Battle was joined across the Land, and for a time it\nseemed that the Queen would prevail. Her heroes were mighty of hand, and none\nwere mightier than Berek, who was said to be a match for any King. But as the\nbattle raged, a shadow, a gray cloud from the east, fell over the hosts. The\nQueen's defenders were stricken at heart, and their strength left them. But her\nenemies found a power of madness in the shadow. They forgot their humanity-they\nchopped and trampled and clawed and bit and maimed and defiled until their gray\nonslaught whelmed the heroes, and Berek's comrades broke one by one into\ndespair and death. So the battle went until Berek was the last hater of the\nshadow left alive.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;But he fought on, heedless of his fate and the number\nof his foes, and souls fell dead under his sword like autumn leaves in a gale.\nAt last, the King himself, filled with the fear and madness of the shadow,\nchallenged Berek, and they fought. Berek stroked mightily, but the shadow\nturned his blade. So the contest was balanced until one blow of the King's ax\ncleft Berek's hand. Then Berek's sword fell to the ground, and he looked about\nhim-looked and saw the shadow, and all his brave comrades dead. He cried a\ngreat cry of despair, and, turning, fled the battleground.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Thus he ran, hunted by death, and the memory of the\nshadow was upon him. For three days he ran, never stopping, never resting -and for\nthree days the King's host came behind him like a murderous beast, panting for\nblood. At the last of his strength and the extremity of his despair, he came to\nMount Thunder. Climbing the rock-strewn slope, he threw himself down atop a\ngreat boulder and wept, saying,</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>`Alas for the Earth. We are overthrown, and have no friend\nto redeem us. Beauty shall pass utterly from the Land.' &quot;But the rock on\nwhich he lay replied, `There is a Friend for a heart with the wisdom to see\nit.' &quot; `The stones are not my friends,' cried Berek. `See, my enemies ride\nthe Land, and no convulsion tears the earth from under their befouling feet.'\n&quot; `That may be,' said the rock. `They are alive as much as you, and need\nthe ground to stand upon. Yet there is a Friend for you in the Earth, if you\nwill pledge your soul to its healing.' &quot;Then Berek stood upon the rock,\nand beheld his enemies close upon him. He took the pledge, sealing it with the\nblood of his riven hand. The Earth replied with thunder; from the heights of\nthe mountain came great stone Fire-Lions, devouring everything in their path.\nThe King and all his host were laid waste, and Berek alone stood above the\nrampage on his boulder like a tall ship in the sea.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;When the rampage had passed, Berek did homage to the\nLions of Mount Thunder, promising respect and communion and service for the\nEarth from himself and all the generations which followed him upon the Land.\nWielding the first Earthpower, he made the Staff of Law from the wood of the\nOne Tree, and with it began the healing of the Land. In the fullness of time,\nBerek Halfhand was given the name Heartthew, and he became the Lord-Fatherer,\nthe first of the Old Lords. Those who followed his path flourished in the Land\nfor two thousand years.&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>For a long moment, there was silence over the gathering when\nAtiaran finished. Then together, as if their pulses moved to a single beat, the\nStonedownors began to surge forward, stretching out their hands to touch her in\nappreciation. She spread her arms to hug as many of her friends as she could,\nand those who could not reach her embraced each other, sharing the oneness of\ntheir communal response.<br clear=all style='page-break-before:always'>\n</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><a name=\"_Toc370739012\"><span class=Heading1Char><span\nstyle='font-size:16.0pt;line-height:105%'>SEVEN: Lena</span></span></a></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>Alone in the night-alone because he could not share the\nspontaneous -embracing impulse of the Stonedown Covenant felt suddenly trapped,\nthreatened. A pressure of darkness cramped his lungs; he could not seem to get\nenough air. A leper's claustrophobia was on him, a leper's fear of crowds, of\nunpredictable behavior. Berek! he panted with mordant intensity. These people\nwanted him to be a hero.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>With a stiff jerk of repudiation, he swung away from the\ngathering, went stalking in high dudgeon between the houses as if the\nStonedownors had dealt him a mortal insult.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>Berek! His chest heaved at the thought. Wild magic! It was\nridiculous. Did not these people know he was a leper? Nothing could be less\npossible for him than the kind of heroism they saw in Berek Halfhand. But Lord\nFoul had said, He intends you to be my final foe. He chose you to destroy me.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>In stark dismay, he glimpsed the end toward which the path\nof the dream might be leading him; he saw himself drawn ineluctably into a\nconfrontation with the Despiser.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>He was trapped. Of course he could not play the hero in some\ndream war. He could not forget himself that much; forgetfulness was suicide.\nYet he could not escape this dream without passing through it, could not return\nto reality without awakening. He knew what would happen to him if he stood\nstill and tried to stay sane. Already, only this far from the lights of the\ngathering, he felt dark night beating toward him, circling on broad wings out\nof the sky at his head.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>He lurched to a halt, stumbled to lean against a wall,\ncaught his forehead in his hands.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>I can't -he panted. All his hopes that this Land might\nconjure away his impotence, heal his sore heart somehow, fell into ashes.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>Can't go on. Can't stop.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>What's happening to me?</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>Abruptly, he heard steps running toward him. He jumped\nerect, and saw Lena hurrying to join him. The swing of her graveling pot cast\nmad shadows across her figure as she moved. In a few more strides, she slowed,\nthen stopped, holding her pot so that she could see him clearly. &quot;Thomas\nCovenant?&quot; she asked tentatively. &quot;Are you not well?&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;No,&quot; he lashed at her, &quot;I'm not well.\nNothing's well, and it hasn't been since&quot;-the words caught in his throat\nfor an instant &quot;since I was divorced.&quot; He glared at her, defying her\nto ask what a divorce was.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>The way she held her light left most of her face in\ndarkness; he could not see how she took his outburst. But some inner sensitivity\nseemed to guide her. When she spoke, she did not aggravate his pain with crude\nquestions or condolences. Softly, she said, &quot;I know a place where you may\nbe alone.&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>He nodded sharply. Yes! He felt that his distraught nerves\nwere about to snap. His throat was thick with violence. He did not want anyone\nto see what happened to him.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>Gently, Lena touched his arm, led him away from the\nStonedown toward the river. Under the dim starlight they reached the banks of.\nthe Mithil, then turned down river. In half a mile, they came to an old stone\nbridge that gleamed with a damp, black reflection, as if it had just arisen\nfrom the water for Covenant's use. The suggestiveness of that thought made him\nstop. He saw the span as a kind of threshold; crises lurked in the dark hills\nbeyond the far riverbank. Abruptly, he asked, &quot;Where are we going?&quot;\nHe was afraid that if he crossed that bridge he would not be able to recognize\nhimself when he returned.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;To the far side,&quot; Lena said. &quot;There you may\nbe alone. Our people do not often cross the Mithil-it is said that the western\nmountains are not friendly, that the ill of Doom's Retreat which lies behind\nthem has bent their spirit. But I have walked over all the western valley,\nstone-questing for suru-pa-maerl images, and have met no harm. There is a place\nnearby where you will not be disturbed.&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>For all its appearance of age, the bridge had an\nuntrustworthy look to Covenant's eye. The unmortared joints seemed tenuous,\nheld together only by dim, treacherous, star-cast shadows. When he stepped onto\nthe bridge, he expected his foot to slip, the stones to tremble. But the arch\nwas steady. At the top of the span, he paused to lean on the low side wall of\nthe bridge and gaze down at the river.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>The water flowed blackly under him, grumbling over its long\nprayer for absolution in the sea. And he looked into it as if he were asking it\nfor courage. Could he not simply ignore the things that threatened him, ignore\nthe opposing impossibilities, madnesses, of his situation-return to the Stonedown\nand pretend with blithe guile that he was Berek Halfhand reborn?</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>He could not. He was a leper; there were some lies he could\nnot tell.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>With a sharp twist of nausea, he found that he was pounding\nhis fists on the wall. He snatched his hands up, tried to see if he had injured\nhimself, but the dim stars showed him nothing.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>Grimacing, he turned and followed Lena down to the western\nbank of the Mithil.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>Soon they reached their destination. Lena led Covenant\ndirectly west for a distance, then up a steep hill to the right, and down a\nsplintered ravine toward the river again. Carefully, they picked their way\nalong the ragged bottom of the ravine as if they were balancing on the broken\nkeel of a ship; its shattered hull</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>rose up on either side of them, narrowing their horizons. A\nfew trees stuck out of the sides like spars, and near the river the hulk lay\naground on a swath of smooth sand which faded toward a flat rock promontory\njutting into the river. The Mithil complained around this rock, as if annoyed\nby the brief constriction of its banks, and the sound blew up the ravine like a\nsea breeze moaning through a reefed wreck.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>Lena halted on the sandy bottom. Kneeling, she scooped a\nshallow basin in the sand and emptied her pot of graveling into it. The\nfire-stones gave more light from the open basin, so that the ravine bottom was\nlit with yellow, and shortly Covenant felt a quiet warmth from the graveling.\nThe touch of the stones' glow made him aware that the night was cool, a\npleasant night for sitting around a fire. He squatted beside the graveling with\na shiver like the last keen quivering of imminent hysteria.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>After she had settled the graveling in the sand, Lena moved\naway toward the river. Where she stood on the promontory, the light barely\nreached her, and her form was dark; but Covenant could see that her face was\nraised to the heavens.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>He followed her gaze up the black face of the mountains, and\nsaw that the moon was rising. A silver sheen paled the stars along the rim of\nrock, darkening the valley with its shadow; but the shadow soon passed down the\nravine, and moonlight fell on the river, giving it the appearance of old\nargent. And as the full moon arose from the mountains, it caught Lena, cast a\nwhite haze like a caress across her head and shoulders. Standing still by the\nriver, she held her head up to the moon, and Covenant watched her with an odd\ngrim jealousy, as if she were poised on a precipice that belonged to him.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>Finally, when the moonlight had crossed the river into the\neastern valley, Lena lowered her head and returned to the circle of the\ngraveling. Without meeting Covenant's gaze, she asked softly, &quot;Shall I\ngo?&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>Covenant's palms itched as if he wanted to strike her for\neven suggesting that she might stay. But at the same time he was afraid of the\nnight; he did not want to face it alone. Awkwardly he got to his feet, paced a\nshort distance away from her. Scowling up the hulk of the ravine, he fought to\nsound neutral as he said, &quot;What do you want?&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>Her reply, when it came, was quiet and sure. &quot;I want to\nknow more of you.&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>He winced, ducked his head as if claws had struck at him out\nof the air. Then he snatched himself erect again.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Ask.&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Are you married?&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>At that, he whirled to face her as if she had stabbed him in\nthe back. Under the hot distress of his eyes and his bared teeth, she faltered,\nlowered her eyes and turned her head away. Seeing her uncertainty, he felt that\nhis face had betrayed him again. He had not willed the snarling contortion of\nhis features. He wanted to contain himself, not give way like this. not in\nfront of her. Yet she aggravated his distress more than anything else he had\nencountered. Striving for self-control, he snapped, &quot;Yes. No. It doesn't\nmatter. Why ask?&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>Under his glare, Lena dropped to the sand, sat on her feet\nby the graveling, and watched him obliquely from beneath her eyebrows. When she\nsaid nothing immediately, he began to pace up and down the swath of sand. As he\nmoved, he turned and pulled fiercely at his wedding ring.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>After a moment, Lena answered with an air of irrelevance,\n&quot;There is a man who desires to marry me.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>He is Triock son of Thuler. Though I am not of age he woos\nme, so that when the time comes I will ma no other choice. But if I were of age\nnow I would not marry him. Oh, he is a good man in his way-a good Cattleherd,\ncourageous in defense of his kine. And he is taller than most. But there are\ntoo many wonders in the world, too much power to know and beauty to share and\nto create-and I have not seen the Ranyhyn. I could not marry a Cattleherd who\nde sires no more than a suru-pa-maerl for wife. Rather, I would go to the\nLoresraat as Atiaran my mother did, and I would stay and not falter no matter\nwhat trials the Lore put upon me, until I became a Lord. It is said that such\nthings may happen. Do you think so?&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>Covenant scarcely heard her. He was pacing out his agitation\non the sand, enraged and undercut by an unwanted memory of Joan. Beside his\nlost love, Lena and the silver night of the Land failed of significance. The\nhollowness of his dream became suddenly obvious to his inner view, like an\nunveiled wilderland, a new permutation of the desolation of leprosy. This was\nnot real-it was a torment that he inflicted upon himself in subconscious,\ninvoluntary revolt against his disease and loss. To himself, he groaned, Is it\nbeing outcast that does this? Is being cut off such a shock? By hell! I don't\nneed any more. He felt that he was on the edge of screaming. In an effort to\ncontrol himself, he dropped to the sand with his back to Lena and hugged his\nknees as hard as he could. Careless of the unsteadiness of his voice, he asked,\n&quot;How do your people marry?&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>In an uncomplicated tone, she said, &quot;It is a simple\nthing, when a man and a woman choose each other. After the two have become\nfriends, if they wish to marry they tell the Circle of elders. And the elders\ntake a season to assure themselves that the friendship of the two is secure,\nwith no hidden jealousy or failed promise behind them to disturb their course\nin later years. Then the Stonedown gathers in the center, and the elders take\nthe two in their arms and ask, `Do you wish to share life, in joy and sorrow,\nwork and rest, peace and struggle, to make the Land new?' &quot;The two answer,\n`Life with life, we choose to share the blessings and the service of the Earth.'\n&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>For a moment, her star-lit voice paused reverently. Then she\nwent on, &quot;The Stonedown shouts together,</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>`It is good! Let there be life and joy and power while the\nyears last!' Then the day is spent in joy, and th new mates teach new games and\ndances and songs to the people, so that the happiness of the Stonedown is\nrenewed, and communion and pleasure do not fail in the Land.&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>She paused again shortly before continuing: &quot;The\nmarriage of Atiaran my mother with Trell my father was a bold day. The elders\nwho teach us have spoken of it many times. Every day in the season of\nassurance, Trell climbed the mountains, searching forgotten paths and lost\ncaves, hidden falls and new-broken crevices, for a stone of orcrest -a precious\nand many-powered rock. For there was a drought upon the South Plains at that\ntime, and the life of the Stonedown faltered in famine.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Then, on the eve of the marriage, he found his\ntreasure-a piece of orcrest smaller than a fist. And in the time of joy, after\nthe speaking of the rituals, he and Atiaran my mother saved the Stonedown.\nWhile she sang a deep prayer to the Earth-a song known in the Loresraat but\nlong forgotten among our people he held the orcrest in his hand and broke it\nwith the strength of his fingers. As the stone fell into dust, thunder rolled\nbetween the mountains, though there were no clouds, and one bolt of lightning\nsprang from the dust in his hand. Instantly, the blue sky turned black with\nthunderheads, and the rain began to fall. So the famine was broken, and the\nStonedownors smiled on the coming days like a people reborn.&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>Though he clenched his legs with all his strength, Covenant\ncould not master his dizzy rage. Joan! Lena's tale struck him like a mockery of\nhis pains and failures.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>I can't.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>For a moment, his lower jaw shuddered under the effort he\nmade to speak. Then he leaped up and dashed toward the river. As he covered the\nshort distance, he bent and snatched a stone out of the sand. Springing onto\nthe promontory, he hurled the stone with all the might of his body at the\nwater.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>Can't-!</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>A faint splash answered him, but at once the sound died\nunder the heedless plaint of the river, and the ripples were swept away.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>Softly at first, Covenant said to the river, &quot;I gave\nJoan a pair of riding boots for a wedding present.&quot; Then, shaking his\nfists wildly, he shouted, &quot;Riding boots! Does my impotence surprise\nyou?!&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>Unseen and incomprehending, Lena arose and moved toward\nCovenant, one hand stretched out as if to soothe the violence knotted in his\nback. But she paused a few steps away from him, searching for the right thing\nto say. After a moment, she whispered, &quot;What happened to your wife?&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>Covenant's shoulders jerked. Thickly, he said, &quot;She's\ngone.&quot; &quot;How did she die?&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Not her-me. She left me. Divorced. Terminated. When I\nneeded her.&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>Indignantly, Lena wondered, &quot;Why would such a thing\nhappen while there is life?&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I'm not alive.&quot; She heard fury climbing to the\ntop of his voice. &quot;I'm a leper. Outcast unclean.- Lepers are ugly and\nfilthy. And abominable.&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>His words filled her with horror and protest. &quot;How can\nit be?&quot; she moaned. &quot;You are not-abominable. What world is it that\ndares treat you so?&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>His muscles jumped still higher in his shoulders, as if his\nhands were locked on the throat of some tormenting demon. &quot;It's real. That\nis reality. Fact. The kind of thing that kills you if you don't believe\nit.&quot; With a gesture of rejection toward the river, he gasped, &quot;This\nis a nightmare.&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>Lena flared with sudden courage. &quot;I do not believe it.\nIt may be that your world-but the Land-ah, the Land is real.&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>Covenant's back clenched abruptly still, and he said with\npreternatural quietness, &quot;Are you trying to drive me crazy?&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>His ominous tone startled her, chilled her. For an instant,\nher courage stumbled; she felt the river and the ravine closing around her like\nthe jaws of a trap. Then Covenant whirled and struck her a stinging slap across\nthe face.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>The force of the blow sent her staggering back into the\nlight of the graveling. He followed quickly, his face contorted in a wild grin.\nAs she caught her balance, got one last, clear, terrified look at him, she felt</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>sure that he meant to kill her. The thought paralyzed her.\nShe stood dumb and helpless while he approached.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>Reaching her, he knotted his hands in the front of her shift\nand rent the fabric like a veil. She could not move. For an instant, he stared\nat her, at her high, perfect breasts and her short slip, with grim triumph in\nhis eyes, as though he had just exposed some foul plot. Then he gripped her\nshoulder with his left hand and tore away her slip with his right, forcing her\ndown to the sand as he uncovered her.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>Now she wanted to resist, but her limbs would not move; she\nwas helpless with anguish.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>A moment later, he dropped the burden of his weight on her\nchest, and her loins were stabbed with a wild, white fire that broke her\nsilence, made her scream. But even as she cried out she knew that it was too\nlate for her. Something that her people thought of as a gift had been torn from\nher.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>But Covenant did not feel like a taker. His climax flooded\nhim as if he had fallen into a Mithil of molten fury. Suffocating in passion,\nhe almost swooned. Then time seemed to pass him by, and he lay still for\nmoments that might have been hours for all he knew -hours during which his\nworld could have crumbled, unheeded.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>At last he remembered the softness of Lena's body under him,\nfelt the low shake of her sobbing. With an effort, he heaved himself up and to\nhis feet. When he looked down at her in the graveling light, he saw the blood\non her loins. Abruptly, his head became giddy, unbalanced, as though he were\npeering over a precipice. He turned and hurried with a shambling, unsteady gait\ntoward the river, pitched himself fiat on the rock, and vomited the weight of\nhis guts into the water. And the Mithil erased his vomit as cleanly as if\nnothing had happened.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>He lay still on the rock while the exhaustion of his\nexacerbated nerves overcame him. He did not hear Lena arise, gather the shreds\nof her clothing, speak, or climb away out of the shattered ravine. He heard nothing\nbut the long lament of the river-saw nothing but the ashes of his burnt-out\npassion-felt nothing but the dampness of the rock on his cheeks like tears.<br\nclear=all style='page-break-before:always'>\n</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><a name=\"_Toc370739013\"><span class=Heading1Char><span\nstyle='font-size:16.0pt;line-height:105%'>EIGHT: The Dawn of the Message</span></span></a></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>THEhard bones of the rock slowly brought Thomas Covenant out\nof dreams of close embraces. For a time, he drifted on the rising current of\nthe dawn-surrounded on his ascetic, sufficient bed by the searching\nself-communion of the river, the fresh odors of day, the wheeling cries of\nbirds as they sprang into the sky. While his self-awareness, returned, he felt\nat peace, harmonious with his context; and even the uncompromising hardness of\nthe stone seemed apposite to him, a proper part of a whole morning.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>His first recollections of the previous night were of\norgasm, heartrending, easing release and satisfaction so precious that he would\nhave been willing to coin his soul to make such things part of his real life.\nFor a long moment of joy, he re-experienced that sensation. Then he remembered\nthat to get it he had hurt Lena.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>Lena!</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>He rolled over, sat up in the dawn. The sun had not yet\nrisen above the mountains, but enough light reflected into the valley from the\nplains for him to see that she was gone.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>She had left her fire burning in the sand up the ravine from\nhim. He lurched to his feet, scanned the ravine and both banks of the Mithil\nfor some sign of her-or, his imagination leaped, of Stonedownors seeking\nvengeance. His heart thudded; all those rockstrong people would not be\ninterested in his explanations or apologies. He searched for evidence of\npursuit like a fugitive.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>But the dawn was as undisturbed as if it contained no\npeople, no crimes or desires for punishment. Gradually, Covenant's panic\nreceded. After a last look around, he began to prepare for whatever lay ahead\nof him.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>He knew that he should get going at once, hurry along the\nriver toward the relative safety of the plains. But he was a leper, and could\nnot undertake solitary journeys lightly. He needed to organize himself.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>He did not thing about Lena; he knew instinctively that he\ncould not afford to think about her. He had violated her trust, violated the\ntrust of the Stonedown; that was as close to his last night's rage as he could\ngo. It was past, irrevocable-and illusory, like the dream itself. With an\neffort that made him tremble, he put it behind him. Almost by accident on\nKevin's Watch, he had discovered the answer to all such insanity: keep moving,\ndon't think about it, survive. That answer was even more necessary now. His\n&quot;Berek&quot; fear of the previous evening seemed relatively unimportant.\nHis resemblance to a legendary hero was only a part of a dream, not a\ncompulsory fact or demand. He put it behind him also. Deliberately, he gave\nhimself a thorough scrutiny and VSE.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>When he was sure that he had no hidden injuries, no\ndangerous purple spots, he moved out to the end of the promontory. He was still\ntrembling. He needed more discipline, mortification; his hands shook as if they\ncould not steady themselves without his usual shaving ritual. But the penknife\nin his pocket was inadequate for shaving. After a moment, he took a deep\nbreath, gripped the edge of the rock, and dropped himself, clothes and all,\ninto the river for a bath.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>The current tugged at him seductively, urging him to float\noff under blue skies into a spring day. But the water was too cold; he could\nonly stand the chill long enough to duck and thrash in the stream for a moment.\nThen he hauled himself onto the rock and stood up, blowing spray off his face.\nWater from his hair kept running into his eyes, blinding him momentarily to the\nfact that Atiaran stood on the sand by the graveling. She contemplated him with\na grave, firm glance.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>Covenant froze, dripping as if he had been caught in the\nmiddle of a flagrant act. For a moment, he and Atiaran measured each other\nacross the sand and rock. When she started to speak, he cringed inwardly,\nexpecting her to revile, denounce, hurl imprecations. But she only said,\n&quot;Come to the graveling. You must dry yourself.&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>In surprise, he scrutinized her tone with all the high\nalertness of his senses, but he could hear nothing in it except determination\nand quiet sadness. Suddenly he guessed that she did not know what had happened\nto her daughter.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>Breathing deeply to control the labor of his heart, he moved\nforward and huddled down next to the graveling. His mind raced with improbable\nspeculations to account for Atiaran's attitude, but he kept his face to the\nwarmth and remained silent, hoping that she would say something to let him know\nwhere he</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>stood with her.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>Almost at once, she murmured, &quot;I knew where to find\nyou. Before I returned from speaking with the Circle of elders, Lena told Trell\nthat you were here.&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>She stopped, and Covenant forced himself to ask, &quot;Did\nhe see her?&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>He knew that it was a suspicious question. But Atiaran\nanswered simply, &quot;No. She went to spent the night with a friend. She only\ncalled out her message as she passed our home.&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>Then for several long moments Covenant sat still and\nvoiceless, amazed by the implications of what Lena had done. Only called out!\nAt first, his brain reeled with thoughts of relief. He was safe-temporarily, at\nleast. With her reticence, Lena had purchased precious time for him. Clearly,\nthe people of this Land were prepared to make sacrifices After another moment,\nhe understood that she had not made her sacrifice for him. He could not imagine\nthat she cared for his personal safety. No, she chose to protect him because he\nwas a Berek-figure, a bearer of messages to the Lords. She did not want his\npurpose to be waylaid by the retribution of the Stonedown. This was her\ncontribution to the defense of the Land from Lord Foul the Gray Slayer.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>It was a heroic contribution. In spite of his discipline,\nhis fear, he sensed the violence Lena had done herself for the sake of his\nmessage. He seemed to see her huddling naked behind a rock in the foothills\nthroughout that bleak night, shunning for the first time in her young life the\nopen arms of her community bearing the pain and shame of her riven body alone\nso that he would not be required to answer for it. An unwanted memory of the\nblood on her loins writhed in him.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>His shoulders bunched to strangle the thought. Through\nlocked teeth, he breathed to himself, I've got to go to the Council.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>When he had steadied himself, he asked grimly, &quot;What\ndid the elders say?&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;There was little for them to say,&quot; she replied in\na flat voice. &quot;I told them what I know of you-and of th</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>Land's peril.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>They agreed that I must guide you to Lord's Keep. For that\npurpose I have come to you now. See &quot;-she indicated two packs lying near\nher feet &quot;I am ready. Trell my husband has given me his blessing. It\ngrieves me to go without giving my love to Lena my daughter, but time is\nurgent. You have not told me all your message, but I sense that from this day\nforward each delay is hazardous. The elders will &quot; give</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>thought to the defense of the plains. We must.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>Covenant met her eyes, and this time he understood the sad\ndetermination in them. She was afraid, and did not believe that she would live\nto return to her family. He felt a sudden pity for her. Without fully\ncomprehending what he said, he tried to reassure her. &quot;Things aren't as\nbad as they might be. A Cavewight has found the Staff of Law, and I gather he\ndoesn't really know how to use it. Somehow, the Lords have got to get it away\nfrom him.&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>But his attempt miscarried. Atiaran stiffened and said,\n&quot;Then the life of the Land is in our speed. Alas that we cannot go to the\nRanyhyn for help. But the Ramen have little countenance for the affairs of the\nLand, and no Ranyhyn has been ridden, save by Lord or Bloodguard, since the age\nbegan. We must walk, Thomas Covenant, and Revelstone is three hundred long\nleagues distant. Is your clothing dry? We must be on our way.&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>Covenant was ready; he had to get away from this place. He\ngathered himself to his feet and said, &quot;Fine. Let's go.&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>However, the look that Atiaran gave him as he stood held\nsomething unresolved. In a low voice as if she were mortifying herself, she\nsaid, &quot;Do you trust me to guide you, Thomas Covenant? You do not know me.\nI failed in the Loresraat.&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>Her tone seemed to imply not that she was undependable, but\nthat he had the right to judge her. But he was in no position to judge anyone.\n&quot;I trust you,&quot; he rasped. &quot;Why not? You said yourself-&quot; He\nfaltered, then forged ahead. &quot;You said yourself that I come to save or\ndamn the Land.&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;True,&quot; she returned simply. &quot;But you do not\nhave the stink of a servant of the Gray Slayer. My heart tells me that it is\nthe fate of the Land to put faith in you, for good or ill.&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Then let's go.&quot; He took the pack that Atiaran\nlifted toward him and shrugged his shoulders into the straps. But before she\nput on her own pack, she knelt to the graveling in the sand. Passing her hands\nover the fire-stones, she began a low humming-a soft tune that sounded ungainly\nin her mouth, as if she were unaccustomed to it-and under her waving gestures\nthe yellow light faded. In a moment, the stones had lapsed into a pale, pebbly\ngray, as if she had lulled them to sleep, and their heat dissipated. When they\nwere cold, she scooped them into their pot, covered it, and stored it in her\npack.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>The sight reminded Covenant of all the things he did not\nknow about this dream. As Atiaran got to her feet, he said, &quot;There's only\none thing I need. I want you to talk to me-tell me all about the Loresraat and\nthe Lords and everything I might be interested in.&quot; Then because he could\nnot give her the reason for his request, he concluded lamely, &quot;It'll pass\nthe time.&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>With a quizzical glance at him, she settled her pack on her\nshoulders. &quot;You are strange, Thomas Covenant. I think you are too eager to\nknow my ignorance. But what I know I will tell you-though without your raiment\nand speech it would pass my belief to think you an utter stranger to the Land.\nNow come. There are treasure-berries aplenty along our way this morning. They\nwill serve as breakfast. The food we carry must be kept for the chances of the\nroad.&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>Covenant nodded, and followed her as she began climbing out\nof the ravine. He was relieved to be moving again, and the distance passed\nquickly. Soon they were down by the river, approaching the bridge.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>Atiaran strode straight onto the bridge, but when she\nreached the top of the span she stopped. A moment after Covenant joined her,\nshe gestured north along the Mithil toward the distant plains. &quot;I tell you\nopenly, Thomas Covenant,&quot; she said, &quot;I do not mean to take a direct\npath to Lord's Keep. The Keep is west of north from us, three hundred leagues\nas the eye sees across the Center Plains of the Land. There many people live,\nin Stonedown and Woodhelven, and it might chance that both road and help could\nbe found to take us where we must go. But we could not hope for horses. They\nare rare in th</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>Land, and few folk but those of Revelstone know them.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;It is in my heart that we may save time by journeying\nnorth, across the Mithil when it swings east, and so into the land of Andelain,\nwhere the fair Hills are the flower of all the beauties of the Earth. There we\nwill reach the Soulsease River, and it may be that we will find a boat to carry\nus up that sweet stream, past the westland of Trothgard, where the promises of\nthe Lords are kept, to great Revelstone itself, the</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>Lord's Keep. All travelers are blessed by the currents of\nthe Soulsease, and our journey will end sooner if we find a carrier there. But\nwe must pass within fifty leagues of Mount Thunder-Gravin Threndor.&quot; As\nshe said the ancient name, a shiver seemed to run through her voice. &quot;It\nis there or nowhere that the Staff of Law has been found, and I do not wish to\ngo even as close as Andelain to the wrong wielder of such might.&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>She paused for a moment, hesitating, then went on:\n&quot;There would be rue unending if a corrupt Cavewight gained possession of\nthe ring you bear-the evil ones are quick to unleash such forces as wild magic.\nAnd even were the Cavewight unable to use the ring, I fear that ur-viles still\nlive under Mount Thunder. They are lore-wise creatures, and white gold would\nnot surpass them.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;But time rides urgently on us, and we must save it\nwhere we may. And there is another reason for seeking the passage of Andelain\nat this time of year-if we hasten. But I should not speak of it. You will see\nit and rejoice, if no ill befall us on our way.&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>She fixed her eyes on Covenant, turning all their inward\nstrength on him, so that he felt, as he had the previous evening, that she was\nsearching for his weaknesses. He feared that she would discover his night's\nwork in his face, and he had to force himself to meet her gaze until she said,\n&quot;Now tell me, Thomas Covenant. Will you go where I lead?&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>Feeling both shamed and relieved, he answered, &quot;Let's\nget on with it. I'm ready.&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;That is well.&quot; She nodded, started again toward\nthe east bank. But Covenant spent a moment looking down at the river. Its soft\nplaint sounded full of echoes, and they seemed to moan at him with serene\nirony, Does my impotence surprise you? A cloud of trouble darkened his face,\nbut he clenched himself, rubbed his ring, and stalked away after Atiaran,\nleaving the Mithil to flow on its way like a stream of forgetfulness or a border\nof death.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>As the sun climbed over the eastern mountains, Atiaran and\nCovenant were moving north, downstream along the river toward the open plains.\nAt first, they traveled in silence. Covenant was occupied with short forays\ninto the hills to his right, gathering aliantha. He found their tangy peach\nflavor as keenly delicious as before; a fine essence in their juice made hunger\nand taste into poignant sensations. He refrained from taking all the berries\noff any one bush he had to range away from Atiaran's sternly forward track\noften to get enough food to satisfy him-and he scattered the seeds faithfully,\nas Lena had taught him. Then he had to trot to catch up with Atiaran. In this\nway, he passed nearly a league, and when he finished eating, the valley was\nperceptibly broader. He made one last side trip-this time to the river for a\ndrink-then hurried to take a position beside Atiaran.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>Something in the set of her features seemed to ask him not\nto talk, so he disciplined himself to stillness with survival drills. Then he\nstrove to regain the mechanical ticking stride which had carried him so far\nfrom Haven Farm. Atiaran appeared resigned to a trek of three hundred leagues,\nbut he was not. He sensed that he would need all his leper's skills to hike for\neven a day without injuring himself. In the rhythm of his steps, he struggled\nto master the unruliness of his situation.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>He knew that eventually he would have to explain his\npeculiar danger to Atiaran. He might need her help, at least her comprehension.\nBut not yet-not yet. He did not have enough control.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>But after a while, she changed direction, began angling away\nfrom the river up into the northeastern foothills. This close to the mountains,\nthe hills were steep and involuted, and she seemed to be following no path.\nBehind her, Covenant scrambled up and staggered down the rocky, twisting\nslopes, though the natural lay of the land tried constantly to turn them\nwestward. The sides of his neck started to ache from</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>the weight of his pack, and twitches jumped like incipient\ncramps under his shoulder blades. Soon he was panting heavily, and muttering\nagainst the folly of Atiaran's choice of directions.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>Toward midmorning, she stopped to rest on the downward curve\nof a high hill. She remained standing, but Covenant's muscles were trembling\nfrom the exertion, and he dropped to the ground beside her, breathing hard.\nWhen he had regained himself a little, he panted, &quot;Why didn't we go\naround, north past these hills, then east? Save all this up and down.&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Two reasons&quot; she said shortly. &quot;Ahead there\nis a long file north through the hills-easy walking so that we will save time.\nAnd again&quot;-she paused while she looked around-&quot;we may lose something.\nSince we left the bridge, there has been a fear in me that we are\nfollowed.&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Followed?&quot; Covenant jerked out. &quot;Who?&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I do not know. It may be that the spies of the Gray\nSlayer are already abroad. It is said that his highes servants, his Ravers,\ncannot die while he yet lives. They have no bodies of their own, and their\nspirits wander until they find living beings which they can master. Thus they\nappear as animals or humans, as chance allows, corrupting the life of the Land.\nBut it is my hope that we will not be followed through these hills. Are you\nrested? We must go.&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>After adjusting her robe under the straps of her pack, she\nset off again down the slope. A moment later, Covenant went groaning after her.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>For the rest of the morning, he had to drive himself to\npersevere in the face of exhaustion. His legs grew numb with fatigue, and the weight\non his back seemed to constrict his breathing so that he panted as if he were\nsuffocating. He was not conditioned for such work; lurching unsteadily, he\nstumbled up and down the hills. Time and again, only his boots and tough\ntrousers saved him from damage. But Atiaran moved ahead of him smoothly, with\nhardly a wasted motion or false step, and the sight of her drew him onward.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>But finally she turned down into a long ravine that ran\nnorth as far as he could see, like a cut in the hills. A small stream flowed\ndown the center of the file, and they stopped beside it to drink, bathe their\nfaces, and rest. This time, they both took off their packs and dropped to the\nground. Groaning deeply,</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>Covenant lay flat on his back with his eyes closed.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>For a while he simply relaxed, listened to his own hoarse\nrespiration until it softened and he could hear behind it the wind whistling\nsoftly. Then he opened his eyes to take in his surroundings.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>He found himself looking up four thousand feet at Kevin's\nWatch.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>The view was unexpected; he sat up as if to look at it more\nclosely. The Watch was just east and south from him, and it leaned out into the\nsky from its cliff face like an accusing finger. At that distance, the stone\nlooked black and fatal, and it seemed to hang over the file down which he and\nAtiaran would walk. It reminded him of the Despiser and darkness.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Yes,&quot; Atiaran said, &quot;that is Kevin's Watch.\nThere stood Kevin Landwaster, High Lord and wielder of the Staff, direct\ndescendant of Berek Halfhand, in the last battle against the Gray Slayer. It is\nsaid that there he knew defeat, and mad grief. In the blackness which whelmed\nhis heart he-the most powerful champion in all the ages of the Land-even he,\nHigh Lord Kevin, sworn Earthfriend, brought down the Desecration, the end of\nall things in the Land for many generations. It is not a good omen that you\nhave been there.&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>As she spoke, Covenant turned toward her, and saw that she\nwas ,gazing, not up at the rock, but inward, as if she were considering how\nbadly she would have failed in Kevin's place. Then, abruptly, she gathered\nherself and stood up. &quot;But there is no help for it,&quot; she said.\n&quot;Our path lies under the shadow of the Watch for many leagues. Now we must\ngo on.&quot; When Covenant moaned, she commanded, &quot;Come.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>We dare not go slowly, for fear that we will be too late at\nthe end. Our way is easier now. And if it will help your steps, I will talk to\nyou of the Land.&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>Reaching for his pack, Covenant asked, &quot;Are we still\nbeing followed?&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I do not know. I have neither heard nor seen any sign.\nBut my heart misgives me. I feel some wrong upon our path this day.&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>Covenant pulled on his pack and staggered wincing to his\nfeet. His heart misgave him also, for reasons of its own. Here under Kevin's\nWatch, the humming wind sounded like the thrum of distant vulture wings.\nSettling the pack straps on his raw shoulders, he bent under the weight, and\nwent with Atiaran down the bottom of the file.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>For the most part, the cut was straight and smooth-floored,\nthough never more than fifteen feet- across. However, there was room beside the\nnarrow stream for Atiaran and Covenant to walk together. As they traveled,\npausing at every rare aliantha to pick and eat a few berries, Atiaran sketched\nin a few of the wide blanks in Covenant's knowledge of the Land.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;It is difficult to know how to speak of it,&quot; she\nbegan. &quot;Everything is part of everything, and each question which I can\nanswer raises three more which I cannot. My lore is limited to what all learn\nquickly in their first years in the Loresraat. But I will tell you what I can.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Berek Heartthew's son was Damelon Giantfriend, and his\nson was Loric Vilesilencer, who stemmed the corruption of the Demondim,\nrendering them impotent.&quot; As she spoke, her voice took on a cadence that\nreminded Covenant of her singing. She did not recite dry facts; she narrated a\ntale that was of sovereign importance to her, to the Land. &quot;And Kevin,\nwhom we name Landwaster more in pity than in condemnation of his despair, was\nthe son of Loric, and High Lord in his place when the Staff was passed on. For\na thousand years, Kevin stood at the head of the Council, and he extended the\nEarthfriendship of the Lords beyond anything known before in the Land, and he\nwas greatly honored.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;In his early years, he was wise as well as mighty and\nknowledgeable. When he saw the first hints that the ancient shadow was alive,\nhe looked far into the chances of the future, and what he saw gave him cause to\nfear. Therefore he gathered all his Lore into Seven Wards Seven Wards of\nancient Lore For Land's protection, wall and door and hid them, so that his\nknowledge would not pass from the Land even if he and the Old Lords fell.\n&quot;For many many long years the Land lived on in peace. But during that\ntime, the Gray Slayer rose up in the guise of a friend. In some way, the eyes\nof Kevin were blinded, and he accepted his enemy as a friend and Lord. And for\nthat reason, the Lords and all their works passed from the Earth.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;But when Kevin's betrayal had brought defeat and\nDesolation, and the Land had lain under the bane for many generations, and had\nbegun to heal, it called out to the people who lived in hiding in the Wastes\nand the Northron Climbs. Slowly, they returned. As the years passed, and the\nhomes and villages became secure, some folk traveled, exploring the Land in\nsearch of half-remembered legends. And when they finally braved Giant Woods,\nthey came to the old land of Seareach, and found that the Giants,</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>Rockbrothers of the people of the Land, had survived the\nRitual of Desecration.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;There are many songs, old and new, praising the fealty\nof the Giants-with good reason. When the Giants learned that people had\nreturned to the Land, they began a great journey, sojourning over all the Land\nto every new Stonedown and Woodhelven, teaching the tale of Kevin's defeat and\nrenewing the old Rockbrotherhood. Then, taking with them those people who chose\nto come, the giants ended their journey at Revelstone, the ageless castle-city\nwhich they had riven out of the rock of the mountain for High Lord Damelon, as\nsurety of the bond between them.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;At Revelstone, the Giants gave a gift to the gathered\npeople. They revealed the First Ward, the fundamental store of the beginnings\nof Kevin's Lore. For he had trusted it to the Giants before the last battle.\nAnd the people accepted that Ward and consecrated themselves, swearing\nEarthfriendship and loyalty to the Power and beauty of the Land.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;One thing more they swore-Peace, a calmness of self to\nprotect the Land from destructive emotions like those that maddened Kevin. For\nit was clear to all there gathered that power is a dreadful thing, and that the\nknowledge of power dims the seeing of the wise. When they beheld the First\nWard, they feared a new Desecration. Therefore they swore to master the Lore,\nso that they might heal the Land-and to master themselves, so that they would\nnot fall into the anger and despair which made Kevin his own worst foe.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;These oaths were carried back to all the people of the\nLand, and all the people swore. Then the few who were chosen at Revelstone for\nthe great work took the First Ward to Kurash Plenethor, Stricken Stone, where\nthe gravest damage of the last battle was done. They named the land Trothgard,\nas a token of their promise of healing, and there they founded the Loresraat-a\nplace of learning where they sought to regain the knowledge and power of the\nOld Lords, and to train themselves in the Oath of Peace.&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>Then Atiaran fell silent, and she and Covenant walked down\nthe file in stillness textured by the whispering of the stream and by the occasional\ncalls of the birds. He found that her tale did help him to keep up their pace.\nIt caused him to forget himself somewhat, forget the raw ache of his shoulders\nand feet. And her voice seemed to give him strength; her tale was like a\npromise that any exhaustion borne in the Land's service would not be wasted.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>After a time, he urged her to continue. &quot;Can you tell\nme about the Loresraat?&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>The bitter vehemence of her reply surprised him. &quot;Do\nyou remind me that I am of all people the least worthy to talk of these\nmatters? You, Thomas Covenant, Unbeliever and white gold wielder-do you\nreproach me?&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>He could only stare dumbly at her, unable to fathom the\nyears of struggling that filled her spacious eyes. &quot;I do not need your\nreminders.&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>But a moment later she faced forward again, her expression\nset to meet the north. &quot;Now you reproach me indeed,&quot; she said.\n&quot;I am too easily hurt that the whole world knows what I know so well\nmyself. Like a guilty woman, I fail to believe the innocence of others. Please\npardon me-you should receive better treatment than this.&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>Before he could respond, she forged ahead. &quot;In this way\nI describe the Loresraat. It stands in Trothgard in the Valley of Two Rivers,\nand it is a community of study and learning. To that place go all who will, and\nthere they consecrate themselves to Earthfriendship and the Lore of the Old\nLords.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;This Lore is a deep matter, not mastered yet despite\nall the years and effort that have been given to it. The chiefest problem is\ntranslation, for the language of the Old Lords was not like ours, and the words\nwhich are simple at one place are difficult at another. And after translation,\nthe Lore must be interpreted, and then the skills to use it must be learned.\nWhen I&quot;-she faltered briefly-&quot;when I studied there, the Lorewardens\nwho taught me said that all the Loresraat had not yet passed the surface of\nKevin's mighty knowledge. And that knowledge is only a seventh part of the\nwhole, the First Ward of Seven.&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>Covenant heard an unwitting echo of Foul's contempt in her\nwords, and it made him listen to her still more closely.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Easiest of translation,&quot; she went on, &quot;has\nbeen the Warlore, the arts of battle and defense. But there much skill is\nrequired. Therefore one part of the Loresraat deals solely with those who would\nfollow the Sword, and join the Warward of Lord's Keep. But there have been no\nwars in our time, and in my years at the Loresraat the Warward numbered\nscarcely two thousand men and women.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Thus the chief work of the Loresraat is in teaching\nand studying the language and knowledge of the Earthpower. First, the new\nlearners are taught the history of the Land, the prayers and songs and\nlegends-in time, all that is known of the Old Lords and their struggles against\nthe Gray Slayer. Those who master this become Lorewardens. They teach others,\nor search out new knowledge and power from the First Ward. The price of such\nmastery is high-such purity and determination and insight and courage are\nrequired by Kevin's Lore-and there are some,&quot; she said as if she were resolved\nnot to spare her own feelings, &quot;who cannot match the need. I failed when\nthat which I learned made my heart quail-when the Lorewardens led me to see,\njust a little way, into the Despite of the Gray Slayer. That I could not bear,\nand so I broke my devotion, and returned to Mithil Stonedown to use the little\nthat I knew for my people. And now, when I have forgotten so much, my trial is\nupon me.&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>She sighed deeply, as if it grieved her to consent to her\nfate. &quot;But that is no matter. In the Loresraat, those who follow and\nmaster both Sword and Staff, who earn a place in the Warward and among the\nLorewardens, and who do not turn away to pursue private dreams in isolation, as\ndo the Unfettered those brave hearts are named Lords, and they join the Council\nwhich guides the healing and protection of the Land. From their number, they\nchoose the High Lord, to act for all as the Lore requires:</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>And one High Lord to wield the Law To keep all uncorrupt\nEarth's Power's c.ore &quot;In my years at the Loresraat, the High Lord was\nVariol Tamarantha-mate son of Pentil. But he was old, even for a Lord, and the\nLords live longer than other folk-and our Stonedown has had no news of\nRevelstone or Loresraat for many years. I do not know who leads the Council\nnow.&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>Without thinking, Covenant said, &quot;Prothall son of\nDwillian.&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Ah!&quot; Atiaran gasped. &quot;He knows me. As a\nLorewarden he taught me the first prayers. He will remember that I failed, and\nwill not trust my mission.&quot; She shook her head in pain. Then, after a\nmoment's reflection, she added, &quot;And you have known this. You know all.\nWhy do you seek to shame the rudeness of my knowledge? That is not kind.&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Hellfire!&quot; Covenant snapped. Her reproach made\nhim suddenly angry. &quot;Everybody in this whole business, you and&quot;-but\nhe could not bring himself to say Lena's name&quot; and everyone keep accusing\nme of being some sort of closet expert. I tell you, I don't know one damn thing\nabout this unless someone explains it to me. I'm not your bloody Berek.&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>Atiaran gave him a look full of skepticism-the fruit of\nlong, harsh self-doubt-and he felt an answering urge to prove himself in some\nway. He stopped, pulled himself erect against the weight of his pack.\n&quot;This is the message of Lord Foul the Despiser: `Say to the Council of\nLords, and to High Lord Prothall son of Dwillian, that the uttermost limit of\ntheir span of days upon the Land is seven times seven years from this present\ntime. Before the end of those days are numbered, I will have the command of\nlife and death in my hand.&quot;' Abruptly, he caught himself. His words seemed\nto beat down the file like ravens, and he felt a hot leper's shame in his\ncheeks, as though he had defiled the day. For an instant, complete stillness\nsurrounded him-the birds were as silent as if they had been stricken out of the\nsky, and the stream appeared motionless. In the noon heat, his flesh was slick\nwith sweat.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>For that instant, Atiaran gaped aghast at him. Then she\ncried, &quot;Melenkurion abatha! Do not speak it until you must! I cannot\npreserve us from such ills.&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>The silence shuddered, passed; the stream began chattering\nagain, and a bird swooped by overhead. Covenant wiped his forehead with an\nunsteady hand. &quot;Then stop treating me as if I'm something I'm not.&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;How can I?&quot; she responded heavily. &quot;You are\nclosed to me, Thomas Covenant. I do not see you.&quot; She used the word see as\nif it meant something he did not understand. &quot;What do you mean, you don't\nsee me?&quot; he demanded sourly. &quot;I'm standing right in front of\nyou.&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;You are closed to me,&quot; she repeated. &quot;I do\nnot know whether you are well or ill.&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>He blinked at her uncertainly, then realized that she had\nunwittingly given him a chance to tell her about his leprosy. He took the\nopportunity; he was angry enough for the job now. Putting aside his\nincomprehension, he grated, &quot;Ill, of course. I'm a leper.&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>At this, Atiaran groaned as if he had just confessed to a\ncrime. &quot;Then woe to the Land, for you have the wild magic and can undo us\nall.&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Will you cut that out?&quot; Brandishing his left\nfist, he gritted, &quot;It's just a ring. To remind me of everything I have to\nlive without. It's got no more-wild magic-than a rock.&quot; &quot;The Earth is\nthe source of all power,&quot; whispered Atiaran.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>With an effort, Covenant refrained from shouting his\nfrustration at her. She was talking past him,</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>reacting to him as if his words meant something he had not\nintended. &quot;Back up a minute,&quot; he said. &quot;Let's get this straight.\nI said I was ill. What does that mean to you? Don't you even have diseases in\nthis world?&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>For an instant, her lips formed the word diseases. Then a\nsudden fear tightened her face, and her gaze sprang up past Covenant's left\nshoulder.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>He turned to see what frightened her. He found nothing\nbehind him; but as he scanned the west rim of the file, he heard a scrabbling\nnoise. Pebbles and shale fell into the cut.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;The follower!&quot; Atiaran cried. &quot;Run!\nRun!&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>Her urgency caught him; he spun and followed her as fast as\nhe could go down the file. Momentarily, he forgot his weakness, the weight of\nhis pack, the heat. He pounded after Atiaran's racing heels as if he could hear\nhis pursuer poised above him on the rim of the file. But soon his lungs seemed\nto be tearing under the exertion, and he began to lose his balance. When he\nstumbled, his fragile body almost struck the ground.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>Atiaran shouted, &quot;Run!&quot; but he hauled up short,\nswung trembling around to face the pursuit.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>A leaping figure flashed over the edge of the cut and\ndropped toward him. He dodged away from the plummet, flung up his arms to ward\noff the figure's swinging arm.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>As the attacker passed, he scored the backs of Covenant's\nfingers with a knife. Then he hit the ground and rolled, came to his feet with\nhis back to the east wall of the cut, his knife weaving threats in front of\nhim.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>The sunlight seemed to etch everything starkly in Covenant's\nvision. He saw the unevennesses of the wall, the shadows stretched under them\nlike rictus.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>The attacker was a young man with a powerful frame and dark\nhair-unmistakably a Stonedownor, though taller than most. His knife was made of\nstone, and woven into the shoulders of his tunic was his family insignia, a\npattern like crossed lightning. Rage and hate strained his features as if his\nskull were splitting. &quot;Raver!&quot; he yelled. &quot;Ravisher!&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>He approached swinging his blade. Covenant was forced to\nretreat until he stood in the stream, ankledeep in cool water.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>Atiaran was running toward them, though she was too far away\nto intervene between Covenant and the knife.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>Blood welled from the backs of his fingers. His pulse\nthrobbed in the cuts, throbbed in his fingertips. He heard Atiaran's commanding\nshout: &quot;Triock!&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>The knife slashed closer. He saw it as clearly as if it were\nengraved on his eyeballs. His pulse pounded in his fingertips.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>The young man gathered himself for a killing thrust.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>Atiaran shouted again, &quot;Triock! Are you mad? You swore\nthe Oath of Peace!&quot; In his fingertips?</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>He snatched up his hand, stared at it. But his sight was\nsuddenly dim with awe. He could not grasp what was happening. .</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>That's impossible, he breathed in the utterest astonishment.\nImpossible. His numb, leprosy-ridden fingers were aflame with pain.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>Atiaran neared the two men and stopped, dropped for a moment\nbefore she rasped hoarsely, &quot;Loyalty is due. I forbid your\nvengeance.&quot; &quot;Does he go unpunished?&quot; protested Triock.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;There is peril in the Land,&quot; she answered.\n&quot;Let the Lords punish him.&quot; A taste of blood sharpened her voice.\n&quot;They will know what to think of a stranger who attacks the\ninnocent.&quot; Then her weakness returned. &quot;The matter is beyond me.\nTriock, remember your Oath.&quot; She gripped her shoulders, knotted her\nfingers in the leaf pattern of her robe as if to hold her sorrow down.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>Triock turned toward Covenant. There was something broken in\nthe 'young man's face-a shattered or wasted capacity for contentment, joy. He\nsnarled with the force of an anathema, &quot;I know you, Unbeliever. We will\nmeet again.&quot; Then abruptly he began moving away. He accelerated until he\nwas sprinting, beating out his reproaches on the hard floor of the file. In a\nmoment, he reached a place where the west wall sloped away, and then he was out\nof sight, gone from the cut into the hills.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Impossible,&quot; Covenant murmured. &quot;Can't\nhappen. Nerves don't regenerate.&quot; But his fingers hurt as if they were\nbeing crushed with pain. Apparently nerves did regenerate in the Land. He\nwanted to scream against the darkness and the terror, but he seemed to have\nlost all control of his throat, voice, self.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>As if from a distance made great by abhorrence or pity,\nAtiaran said, &quot;You have made of my heart a wilderland.&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Nerves don't regenerate.&quot; Covenant's throat\nclenched as if he were gagging, but he could not scream. &quot;They\ndon't.&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Does that make you free?&quot; she demanded softly,\nbitterly. &quot;Does it justify your crime?&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Crime?&quot; He heard the word like a knife thrust\nthrough the beating wings. &quot;Crime?&quot; His blood ran from the cuts as if\nhe were a normal man, but the flow was decreasing steadily. With a sudden\nconvulsion, he caught hold of himself, cried miserably, &quot;I'm in\npain!&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>The sound of his wail jolted him, knocked the swirling\ndarkness back a step. Pain! The impossibility bridged a gap for him. Pain was\nfor healthy people, people whose nerves were alive.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>Can't happen. Of course it can't. That proves it -proves\nthis is all a dream.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>All at once, he felt an acute desire to weep. But he was a\nleper, and had spent too much time learning t dam such emotional channels.\nLepers could not afford grief. Trembling feverishly, he plunged his cut hand\ninto the stream.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Pain is pain,&quot; Atiaran grated. &quot;What is your\npain to me? You have done a black deed, Unbeliever violent and cruel, without\ncommitment or sharing. You have given me a pain that no blood or time will</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>wash clean. And Lena my daughter- Ah, I pray that the Lords\nwill punish-punish!&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>The running water was chill and clear. After a moment, his\nfingers began to sting in the cold, and an ache spread up through his knuckles\nto his wrist. Red plumed away from his cuts down the stream, but the cold water\nsoon stopped his bleeding. As he watched the current rinse clean his injury,\nhis grief and fear turned to anger. Because Atiaran was his only companion, he\ngrowled at her, &quot;Why should I go? None of this matters-I don't give a damn\nabout your precious Land.&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;By the Seven!&quot; Atiaran's hard tone seemed to\nchisel words out of the air. &quot;You will go to Revelstone if I must drag you\neach step of the way.&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>He lifted his hand to examine it. Triock's knife had sliced\nhim as neatly as a razor; there were no jagged edges to conceal dirt or roughen\nthe healing. But the cut had reached bone in his middle two fingers, and blood\nstill seeped from them. He stood up. For the first time since he had been\nattacked, he looked at Atiaran.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>She stood a few paces from him, with her hands clenched\ntogether at her heart as if its pulsing hurt her. She glared at him abominably,\nand her face was taut with intimations of fierce, rough strength. He could see\nthat she was prepared to fight him to Revelstone if necessary. She shamed him,\naggravated his ire. Belligerently, he waved his injury at her. &quot;I need a\nbandage.&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>For an instant, her gaze intensified as if she were about to\nhurl herself at him. But then she mastered herself, swallowed her pride. She\nwent over to her pack, opened it, and took out a strip of white cloth, which\nshe tore at an appropriate length as she returned to Covenant. Holding his hand\ncarefully, she inspected the cut, nodded her approval of its condition, then\nbound the soft fabric firmly around his fingers. &quot;I have no\nhurtloam,&quot; she said, &quot;and cannot take the time to search for it. But\nthe cut looks well, and will heal cleanly.&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>When she was done, she went back to her pack. Swinging it\nonto her shoulders, she said, &quot;Come. We have lost time.&quot; Without a\nglance at Covenant, she set off down the file.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>He remained where he was for a moment, tasting the ache of\nhis fingers. There was a hot edge to his hurt, as if the knife were still in\nthe wound. But he had the answer to it now. The darkness had receded somewhat,\nand he could look about him without panic. Yet he was still afraid. He was\ndreaming healthy nerves; he had not realized that he was so close to collapse.\nHelpless, lying unconscious somewhere, he was in the grip of a crisis-a crisis\nof his ability to survive. To weather it he would need every bit of discipline\nor intransigence he could find.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>On an impulse, he bent and tried to pull Triock's knife from\nthe ground with his right hand. His halfgrip slipped when he tugged straight up\non the handle, but by working it back and forth he was able to loosen it, draw\nit free. The whole knife was shaped and polished out of one flat sliver of\nstone, with a haft leather-bound for a secure hold, and an edge that seemed\nsharp enough for shaving. He tested it on his left forearm, and found that it\nlifted off his hair as smoothly as if the blade were lubricated.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>He slipped it under his belt. Then he hitched his pack\nhigher on his shoulders and started after Atiaran.<br clear=all\nstyle='page-break-before:always'>\n</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><a name=\"_Toc370739014\"><span class=Heading1Char><span\nstyle='font-size:16.0pt;line-height:105%'>NINE: Jehannum</span></span></a></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>Before the afternoon was over, he had lapsed into a dull,\nhypnotized throb of pain. His pack straps constricted the circulation in his\narms, multiplied the aching of his hand; his damp socks gave him blisters to\nwhich his toes were acutely and impossibly sensitive; weariness made his\nmuscles as awkward as lead. But Atiaran moved constantly, severely, ahead of\nhim down the file, and he followed her as if he were being dragged by the\ncoercion of her will. His eyes became sightless with fatigue; he lost all sense\nof time, of movement, of everything except pain. He hardly knew that he had\nfallen asleep, and he felt a detached, impersonal sense of surprise when he was\nfinally shaken awake.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>He found himself lying in twilight on the floor of the file.\nAfter rousing him, Atiaran handed him a bowl of hot broth. Dazedly, he gulped\nat it. When the bowl was empty, she took it and handed him a large flask of\nspringwine. He gulped it also.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>From his stomach, the springwine seemed to send long,\nsoothing fingers out to caress and relax each of his raw muscles, loosening\nthem until he felt that he could no longer sit up. He adjusted his pack as a\npillow, then lay down to sleep again. His last sight before his eyes fell shut\nwas of Atiaran, sitting enshadowed on the far side of the graveling pot, her\nface set relentlessly toward the north.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>The next day dawned clear, cool, and fresh. Atiaran finally\nsucceeded in awakening Covenant as darkness was fading from the sky. He sat up\npainfully, rubbed his face as if it had gone numb during the night. A moment\npassed before he recollected the new sensitivity of his nerves; then he flexed\nhis hands, stared at them as if he had never seen them before. They were alive,\nalive.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>He pushed the blanket aside to uncover his feet. When he\nsqueezed his toes through his boots, the pain of his blisters answered sharply.\nHis toes were as alive as his fingers.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>His guts twisted sickly. With a groan, he asked himself, How\nlong-how long is this going to go on? He did not feel that he could endure much\nmore.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>Then he remembered that he had not had on a blanket when he\nwent to sleep the night before. Atiaran must have spread it over him.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>He winced, avoided her eyes by shambling woodenly to the\nstream to wash his face. Where did she find the courage to do such things for\nhim? As he splashed cold water on his neck and cheeks, he found that he was\nafraid of her again.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>But she did not act like a threat. She fed him, checked the\nbandage on his injured hand, packed up the camp as if he were a burden to which\nshe had already become habituated. Only the lines of sleeplessness around her\neyes and the grim set of her mouth showed that she was clenching herself.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>When she was ready to go, he gave himself a deliberate VSE,\nthen forced his shoulders into the straps of his pack and followed her down the\nfile as if her stiff back were a demand he could not refuse.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>Before the day was done, he was an expert on that back. It\nnever compromised; it never admitted a doubt about its authority, never offered\nthe merest commiseration. Though his muscles tightened until they became as\ninarticulate as bone-though the aching rictus of his shoulders made him hunch\nin his pack like a cripple-though the leagues aggravated his sore feet until he\nhobbled along like a man harried by vultures-her back compelled him like an\nultimatum: keep moving or go mad; I permit no other alternatives. And he could\nnot deny her. She stalked ahead of him like a nightmare figure, and he</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>followed as if she held the key to his existence.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>Late in the morning, they left the end of the file, and\nfound themselves on a heathered hillside almost directly north of the high,\ngrim finger of Kevin's Watch. They could see the South Plains off to the west;\nand as soon as the file ended, the stream turned that way, flowing to some\ndistant union with the Mithil. But Atiaran led Covenant still northward,\nweaving her way along fragmentary tracks and across unpathed leas which\nbordered the hills on her right.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>To the west, the grasslands of the plains were stiff with\nbracken, purplish in the sunlight. And to the east, the hills rose calmly,\ncresting a few hundred feet higher than the path which Atiaran chose along\ntheir sides. In this middle ground, the heather alternated with broad swaths of\nbluegrass. The hillsides wore flowers and butterflies around thick copses of\nwattle and clusters of taller trees-oaks and sycamores, a few elms, and some\ngold-leaved trees-Atiaran called them &quot;Gilden&quot;-which looked like\nmaples. All the colors-the trees, the heather, and bracken, the aliantha, the\nflowers, and the infinite azure sky-were vibrant with the eagerness of spring,\nlush and exuberant rebirth of the world.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>But Covenant had no strength to take in such things. He was\nblind and deaf with exhaustion, pain, incomprehension. Like a penitent, he\nplodded on through the afternoon at Atiaran's behest.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>At last the day came to an end. Covenant covered the final\nleague staggering numbly, though he did not pass out on his feet as he had the\nprevious day; and when Atiaran halted and dropped her pack, he toppled to the\ngrass like a, felled tree. But his overstrained muscles twitched as if they\nwere appalled; he could not hold them still without clenching. In involuntary\nrestlessness, he helped Atiaran by unpacking the blankets while she cooked\nsupper. During their meal, the sun set across the plains, streaking the\ngrasslands with shadows and lavender; and when the stars came out he lay and\nwatched them, trying with the help of springwine to make himself relax.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>At last he faded into sleep. But his slumbers were troubled.\nHe dreamed that he was trudging through a desert hour after hour, while a\nsardonic voice urged him to enjoy the freshness of the grass. The pattern ran\nobsessively in his mind until he felt that he was sweating anger. When the dawn\ncame to wake him, he met it as if it were an affront to his sanity.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>He found that his feet were already growing tougher, and his\ncut hand had healed almost completely.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>His overt pain was fading. But his nerves were no less\nalive. He could feel the ends of his socks with his toes, could feel the breeze\non his fingers. Now the immediacy of these inexplicable sensations began to\ninfuriate him. They were evidence of health, vitality-a wholeness he had spent\nlong, miserable months of his life learning to live without-and they seemed to\ninundate him with terrifying implications. They seemed to deny the reality of\nhis disease.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>But that was impossible. It's one or the other, he panted\nfiercely. Not both. Either I'm a leper or I'm not. Either Joan divorced me or\nshe never existed. There's no middle ground.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>With an effort that made him grind his teeth, he averred,\nI'm a leper. I'm dreaming. That's a fact.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>He could not bear the alternative. If he were dreaming, he\nmight still be able to save his sanity, survive, endure. But if the Land were\nreal, actual-- ah, then the long anguish of his leprosy was a dream, and he was\nmad already, beyond hope.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>Any belief was better than that. Better to struggle for a\nsanity he could at least recognize than to submit to a &quot;health&quot; which\nsurpassed all explanation.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>He chewed the gristle of such thoughts for leagues as he\ntrudged along behind Atiaran, but each argument brought him back to the same\nposition. The mystery of his leprosy was all the mystery he could tolerate,\naccept as fact. It determined his response to every other question of\ncredibility.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>It made him stalk along at Atiaran's back as if he were\nready to attack her at any provocation. Nevertheless, he did receive one benefit\nfrom his dilemma. Its immediate presence and tangibility built a kind of wall\nbetween him and the particular fears and actions which had threatened him\nearlier. Certain memories of violence and blood did not recur. And without\nshame to goad it, his anger remained manageable, discrete. It did not impel him\nto rebel against Atiaran's uncompromising lead.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>Throughout that third day, her erect, relentless form did\nnot relax its compulsion. Up slopes and down hillsides, across glens, around\nthickets-along the western margin of the hills-she drew him onward against his\nfuming mind and recalcitrant flesh. But early in the afternoon she stopped\nsuddenly, looked about her as if she had heard a distant cry of fear. Her\nunexpected anxiety startled Covenant, but before he could ask her what was the\nmatter, she started grimly forward again.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>Some time later she repeated her performance. This time,\nCovenant saw that she was smelling the air as if the breeze carried an erratic\nscent of evil. He sniffed, but smelled nothing. &quot;What is it?&quot; he\nasked. &quot;Are we being followed again?&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>She did not look at him. &quot;Would that Trell were\nhere,&quot; she breathed distractedly. &quot;Perhaps he would know why the Land\nis so unquiet.&quot; Without explanation she swung hastening away northward\nonce more.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>That evening she halted earlier than usual. Late in the\nafternoon, he noticed that she was looking for something, a sign of some kind\nin the grass and trees; but she said nothing to explain herself, and so he\ncould do nothing but watch and follow. Then without warning she turned sharply\nto the right, moved into a shallow valley between two hills. They had to skirt\nthe edge of the valley to avoid a large patch of brambles which covered most of\nits bottom; and in a few hundred yards they came to a wide, thick copse in the\nnorthern hill. Atiaran walked around the copse, then unexpectedly vanished into\nit.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>Dimly wondering, Covenant went to the spot where she had\ndisappeared. There he was able to pick out a thin sliver of a path leading into\nthe copse. He had to turn sideways to follow this path around some of the\ntrees, but in twenty feet he came to an open space like a chamber grown into\nthe center of the woods.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>The space was lit by light filtering through the walls,\nwhich were formed of saplings standing closely side by side in a rude\nrectangle; and a faint rustling breeze blew through them. But interwoven\nbranches and leaves made a tight roof for the chamber. It was comfortably large\nenough for three or four people, and along each of its walls were grassy mounds\nlike beds. In one corner stood a larger tree with a hollow center, into which\nshelves had been built, and these were laden with pots and flasks made of both\nwood and stone. The whole place seemed deliberately welcoming and cozy.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>As Covenant looked around, Atiaran set her pack on one of\nthe beds, and said abruptly, &quot;This is a Waymeet.&quot; When he turned a\nface full of questions toward her, she sighed and went on, &quot;A resting\nplace for travelers. Here is food and drink and sleep for any who pass this\nway.&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>She moved away to inspect the contents of the shelves, and\nher busyness forced Covenant to hold onto his questions until a time when she\nmight be more accessible. But while she replenished the supplies in her</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>pack and prepared a meal, he sat and reflected that she was\nnot ever likely to be accessible to him; and he was in no mood to be kept in\nignorance. So after they had eaten, and Atiaran had settled herself for the\nnight, he said with as much gentleness as he could manage, &quot;Tell me more\nabout this place. Maybe I'll need to know sometime.&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>She kept her face away from him, and lay silent in the\ngathering darkness for a while. She seemed to be waiting for courage, and when\nat last she spoke, she sighed only, &quot;Ask.&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>Her delay made him abrupt. &quot;Are there many places like\nthis?&quot; &quot;There are many throughout the Land.&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Why? Who sets them up?&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;The Lords caused them to be made. Revelstone is only\none place, and the people live in many therefore the Lords sought a way to help\ntravelers, so that people might come to Revelstone and to each other more\neasily.&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Well, who takes care of them? There's fresh food\nhere.&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>Atiaran sighed again, as if she found talking to him\narduous. The night had deepened; he could see nothing of her but a shadow as\nshe explained tiredly, &quot;Among the Demondim-spawn that survived the\nDesolation, there were some who recalled Loric Vilesilencer with gratitude.\nThey turned against the ur-viles, and asked the Lords to give them a service to\nperform, as expiation for the sins of their kindred. These creatures, the\nWaynhim, care for the Waymeets -helping the trees to grow, providing food and\ndrink. But the bond between men and Waynhim is fragile, and you will not see\none. They serve for their own reasons, not for love of us-performing simple\ntasks to redeem the evil of their mighty lore.&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>The darkness in the chamber was now complete. In spite of\nhis irritation, Covenant felt ready to sleep. He asked only one more question.\n&quot;How did you find this place? Is there a map?&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;There is no map. A Waymeet is a blessing which one who\ntravels accepts wherever it is found-a token of the health and hospitality of\nthe Land. They may be found when they are needed. The Waynhim leave signs in\nthe surrounding land.&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>Covenant thought he could hear a note of appreciation in her\nvoice which clashed with her reluctance. The sound reminded him of her constant\nburden of conflicts-her sense of personal weakness in the face of the Land's\nstrong need, her desires to both punish and preserve him. But he soon forgot\nsuch things as the image of Waymeets filled his reverie. Enfolded by the smell\nof the fresh grass on which he lay, he swung easily into sleep.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>During the night, the weather changed. The morning came\nglowering under heavy clouds on a ragged wind out of the north, and Covenant\nmet it with a massive frown that seemed to weigh down his forehead. He awoke\nbefore Atiaran called him. Though he had slept soundly in the security of the\nWaymeet, he felt as tired as if he had spent the whole night shouting at\nhimself.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>While Atiaran was preparing breakfast, he took out Triock's\nknife, then scanned the shelves and found a basin for water and a small mirror.\nHe could not locate any soap-apparently the Waynhim relied on the same fine\nsand which he had used in Atiaran's home. So he braced himself to shave without\nlather. Triock's knife felt clumsy in his right hand, and he could not shake\nlurid visions of slitting his throat.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>To marshal his courage, he studied himself in the mirror.\nHis hair was tousled wildly; with his stubbled beard he looked like a rude\nprophet. His lips were thin and tight, like the chiseled mouth of an oracle,\nand there was grit in his gaunt eyes. All he needed to complete the picture was\na touch of frenzy. Muttering silently, All in good time, he brought the knife\nto his cheek.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>To his surprise, the blade felt slick on his skin, and it\ncut his whiskers without having to be scraped over them repeatedly. In a short\ntime, he had given himself a shave which appeared adequate, at least by\ncontrast, and he had not damaged himself. With a sardonic nod toward his\nreflection, he put the blade away in his pack and began eating his breakfast.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>Soon he and Atiaran were ready to leave the Waymeet. She\nmotioned for him to precede her; he went ahead a few steps along the path, then\nstopped to see what she was doing. As she left the chamber, she raised her head\nto the leafy ceiling, and said softly, &quot;We give thanks for the Waymeet.\nThe giving of this gift honors us, and in accepting it we return honor to the\ngiver. We leave in Peace.&quot; Then she followed Covenant out of the copse.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>When they reached the open valley, they found dark clouds\npiling over them out of the north. Tensely, Atiaran looked at the sky, smelled\nthe sir; she seemed distraught by the coming rain. Her reaction made the\nboiling thunderheads appear ominous to Covenant, and when she turned sharply\ndown the valley to resume her northward path, he hurried after her, calling\nout, &quot;What's the matter?&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Ill upon evil,&quot; she replied. &quot;Do you not\nsmell it? The Land is unquiet.&quot; &quot;What's wrong?&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I do not know,&quot; she murmured so quietly that he\ncould barely hear her. &quot;There is a shadow in the air. And this rain-! Ali,\nthe Land!&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;What's wrong with rain? Don't you get rain in the\nspring?&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Not from the north,&quot; she answered over her\nshoulder. &quot;The spring of the Land arises from the southwest. No, this rain\ncomes straight from Gravin Threndor. The Cavewight Staff wrong-wielder tests\nhis power-I feel it. We are too late.&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>She stiffened her pace into the claws of the wind, and\nCovenant pressed on behind her. As the first raindrops struck his forehead, he\nasked, &quot;Does this Staff really run the weather?&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;The Old Lords did not use it so---they had no wish to\nviolate the Land. But who can say what such power may accomplish?&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>Then the full clouts of the storm hit them. The wind\nscourged the rain southward as if the sky were lashing out at them, at every\ndefenseless living thing. Soon the hillsides were drenched with ferocity. The\nwind rent at the trees, tore, battered the grass; it struck daylight from the\nhills, buried the earth in preternatural night. In moments, Atiaran and\nCovenant were soaked, gasping through the torrent. They kept their direction by\nfacing the dark fury, but they could see nothing of the terrain; they staggered\ndown rough slopes, wandered helplessly into hip-deep streams, lurched headlong\nthrough thickets; they forced against the wind as if it were the current of\nsome stinging limbo, some abyss running from nowhere mercilessly into nowhere.\nYet Atiaran lunged onward erect, with careless determination, and the fear of\nlosing her kept Covenant lumbering at her heels.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>But he was wearying rapidly. With an extra effort that made\nhis chest ache, he caught up to Atiaran,</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>grabbed her shoulder, shouted in her ear, &quot;Stop! We've\ngot to stop!&quot; &quot;No!&quot; she screamed back. &quot;We are too late! I\ndo not dare!&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>Her voice barely reached him through the howl of the wind.\nShe started to pull away, and he tightened his grip on her robe, yelling,\n&quot;No choice! We'll kill ourselves!&quot; The rain thrashed brutally; for an\ninstant he almost lost his hold. He got his other arm around her, tugged her\nstreaming face close to his. &quot;Shelter!&quot; he cried. &quot;We've got to\nstop!&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>Through the water, her face had a drowning look as she\nanswered, &quot;Never! No time!&quot; With a quick thrust of her weight and a\nswing of her arms, she broke his grip, tripped him to the ground. Before he\ncould recover, she snatched up his right hand and began dragging him on through\nthe grass and mud, hauling him like an unsupportable burden against the\nopposition of the storm. Her pull was so desperate that she had taken him\nseveral yards before he could heave upward and get his feet under him.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>As he braced himself, her hold slipped off his hand, and she\nfell away from him. Shouting, &quot;By hell, we're going to stop!&quot; he\nleaped after her. But she eluded his grasp, ran unevenly away from him into the\nspite of the storm.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>He stumbled along behind her. For several long moments, he\nslipped and scrambled through the flailing rain after her untouchable back,\nfurious to get his hands on her. But some inner resource galvanized her\nstrength beyond anything he could match; soon he failed at the pace. The rain\nhampered him as if he were trying to run on the bottom of a breaking wave.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>Then a vicious skid sent him sledding down the hill with his\nface full of mud. When he looked up again through the rain and dirt, Atiaran\nhad vanished into the dark storm as if she were in terror of him, dreaded his\ntouch.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>Fighting his way to his feet, Covenant roared at the rampant\nclouds, &quot;Hellfire! You can't do this to me!&quot; Without warning, just as\nhis fury peaked, a huge white flash exploded beside him. He felt that a bolt of\nlightning had struck his left hand.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>The blast threw him up the hill to his right. For uncounted\nmoments, he lay dazed, conscious only of the power of the detonation and the\nflaming pain in his hand. His wedding ring seemed to be on fire. But when he\nrecovered enough to look, he could see no mark on his fingers, and the pain\nfaded away while he was still hunting for its source.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>He shook his head, thrust himself into a sitting position.\nThere were no signs of the blast anywhere around him. He was numbly aware that\nsomething had changed, but in his confusion he could not identify what it was.\nHe climbed painfully to his feet. After only a moment, he spotted Atiaran lying\non the hillside twenty yards ahead of him. His head felt unbalanced with\nbewilderment, but he moved cautiously toward her, concentrating on his\nequilibrium. She lay on her back, apparently unhurt, and stared at him as he\napproached. When he reached her, she said in wonderment, &quot;What have you\ndone?&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>The sound of her voice helped focus his attention.</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>He was able to say without slurring, &quot;Me? I didn't\n-nothing.&quot;</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>Atiaran came slowly to her feet. Standing in front of him, she\nstudied him gravely, uncertainly, as she</p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>said, &quot;Something has aided\nus. See, the storm is less. And the wind is changed-it blows now as it should.\nGravin Threndor no longer threatens. Praise the Earth, Unbeliever, if this is\nnot your doing.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Of course it's not my\ndoing,&quot; murmured Covenant.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;I don't run the\nweather.&quot; There was no asperity in his tone. He was taken aback by his\nfailure to recognize the change in the storm for himself. Atiaran had told the\nsimple truth. The wind had shifted and dropped considerably. The rain fell\nsteadily, but without fury; now it was just a good, solid, spring rain.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant shook his head again. He\nfelt strangely unable to understand. But when Atiaran said gently, &quot;Shall\nwe go?&quot; he heard a note of unwilling respect in her voice. She seemed to\nbelieve that he had in fact done something to the storm.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Numbly, he mumbled,\n&quot;Sure,&quot; and followed her onward again.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>They walked in clean rain for the\nrest of the day. Covenant's sense of mental dullness persisted, and the only\noutside influences that penetrated him were wetness and cold. Most of the day\npassed without his notice in one long, drenched push against the cold. Toward\nevening, he had regained enough of himself to be glad when Atiaran found a\nWaymeet, and he checked over his body carefully for any hidden injuries while\nhis clothes dried by the graveling. But he still felt dazed by what had\nhappened. He could not shake the odd impression that whatever force had changed\nthe fury of the storm had altered him also.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The next day broke clear, crisp,\nand glorious, and he and Atiaran left the Waymeet early in the new spring dawn.\nAfter the strain of the previous day, Covenant felt keenly alert to the joyous\nfreshness of the air and the sparkle of dampness on the grass, the sheen on the\nheather and the bursting flavor of the treasure-berries. The Land around him\nstruck him as if he had never noticed its beauty before. Its vitality seemed\ncuriously tangible to his senses. He felt that he could see spring fructifying\nwithin the trees, the grass, the flowers, hear the excitement of the calling\nbirds, smell the newness of the buds and the cleanliness of the air.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Then abruptly Atiaran stopped and\nlooked about her. A grimace of distaste and concern tightened her features as\nshe sampled the breeze. She moved her head around intently, as if she were\ntrying to locate the source of a threat.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant followed her example, and\nas he did so, a thrill of recognition ran through him. He could tell that there\nwas indeed something wrong in the air, something false. It did not arise in his\nimmediate vicinity-the scents of the trees and turf and flowers, the lush\nafterward of rain, were all as they should be-but it lurked behind those smells\nlike something uneasy, out of place, unnatural in the distance. He understood\ninstinctively that it was the odor of illthe odor of premeditated disease.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>A moment later, the breeze\nshifted; the odor vanished. But that ill smell had heightened his perceptions;\nthe contrast vivified his sense of the vitality of his surroundings. With an\nintuitive leap, he grasped the change which had taken place within him or for\nhim. In some way that completely amazed him, his senses had gained a new\ndimension. He looked at the grass, smelled its freshness-and saw its verdancy,\nits springing life, its fitness. Jerking his eyes to a nearby aliantha, he\nreceived an impression of potency,</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>health, that dumbfounded him.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>His thoughts reeled, groped, then\nsuddenly clarified around the image of health. He was seeing health, smelling\nnatural fitness and vitality, hearing the true exuberance of spring. Health was\nas vivid around him</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>as if the spirit of the Land's\nlife had become palpable, incarnate. It was as if he had stepped without\nwarning into an altogether different universe. Even Atiaran -- she was gazing\nat his entrancement with puzzled surprise-was manifestly healthy, though her\nlife was complicated by uneasiness, fatigue, pain, resolution.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>By hell, he mumbled. Is my leprosy\nthis obvious to her? Then why doesn't she understand-? He turned away from her\nstare, hunted for some way to test both his eyes and hers. After a moment, he\nspotted near the top of a hill a Gilden tree that seemed to have something\nwrong with it. In every respect that he could identify, specify, the tree\nappeared normal, healthy, yet it conveyed a sense of inner rot, an unexpected\npang of sorrow, to his gaze. Pointing at it, he asked Atiaran what she saw.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Soberly, she replied, &quot;I am\nnot one of the lillianrill, but I can see that the Gilden dies. Some blight has\nstricken its heart. Did you not see such things before?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>He shook his head.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Then how does the world from\nwhich you come live?&quot; She sounded dismayed by the prospect of a place in\nwhich health itself was invisible.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>He shrugged off her question. He\nwanted to challenge her, find out what she saw in him. But then he remembered\nher saying, You are closed to me. Now he understood her comment, and the\ncomprehension gave him a feeling of relief. The privacy of his own illness was\nintact, safe. He motioned her northward again, and when after a moment she\nstarted on her way, he followed her with pleasure. For a long time he forgot\nhimself in the sight of so much healthiness.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Gradually, as the day -moved\nthrough afternoon into gloaming and the onset of night, he adjusted to seeing health\nbehind the colors and forms which met his eyes. Twice more his nostrils had\ncaught the elusive odor of wrongness, but he could not find it anywhere near\nthe creek by which Atiaran chose to make camp. In its absence he thought that\nhe would sleep peacefully.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>But somehow a rosy dream of soul\nhealth and beauty became a nightmare in which spirits threw off their bodies\nand revealed themselves to be ugly, rotten, contemptuous. He was glad to wake\nup, glad even to take the risk of shaving without the aid of a mirror.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>On the sixth day, the smell of\nwrong became persistent, and it grew stronger as Atiaran and Covenant worked\ntheir way north along the hills. A brief spring shower dampened their clothes\nin the middle of the morning, but it did not wash the odor from the air. That\nsmell made Covenant uneasy, whetted his anxiety until he seemed to have a cold\nblade of dread poised over his heart.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Still he could not locate,\nspecify, the odor. It keened in him behind the bouquet of the grass and the\ntangy bracken and the aliantha, behind the loveliness of the vital hills, like\nthe reek of a rotting corpse just beyond the range of his nostrils.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Finally he could not endure it any\nlonger in silence. He drew abreast of Atiaran, and asked, &quot;Do you smell\nit?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Without a glance at him, she\nreturned heavily, &quot;Yes, Unbeliever. I smell it. It becomes clear to\nme.&quot; &quot;What does it mean?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;It means that we are walking\ninto peril. Did you not expect it?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Thinking, Hellfire! Covenant\nrephrased his question. &quot;But what does it come from? What's causing\nit?&quot; &quot;How can I say?&quot; she countered. &quot;I am no oracle.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant caught himself on the\nedge of an angry retort. With an effort, he kept his temper. &quot;Then what is\nit?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;It is murder,&quot; Atiaran\nreplied flatly, and quickened her pace to pull away from him. Do not ask me to\nforget, her back seemed to say, and he stumped fuming after it. Cold anxiety\ninched closer to his heart.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>By midafternoon, he felt that his\nperception of wrongness was sharpening at almost every step. His eyes winced up\nand down the hills, as though he expected at any moment to see the source of\nthe smell. His sinuses ached from constantly tasting the odor. But there was\nnothing for him to perceive-nothing but Atiaran's roaming path through the dips\nand hollows and valleys and outcroppings of the hills-nothing but healthy trees\nand thickets and flowers and verdant grass, the blazonry of the Earth's spring\nand nothing but the intensifying threat of something ill in the air. It was a\npoignant threat, and he felt obscurely that the cause would be worth bewailing.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The sensation of it increased\nwithout resolution for some time. But then a sudden change in the tension of\nAtiaran's back warned Covenant to brace himself scant instants before she\nhissed at him to stop. She had just rounded the side of a hill far enough to\nsee into the hollow beyond it. For a moment she froze, crouching slightly and\npeering into the hollow. Then she began running down the hill.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>At once, Covenant followed. In\nthree strides, he reached the spot where she had halted. Beyond him, in the\nbottom of the hollow, stood a single copse like an eyot in a broad glade. He\ncould see nothing amiss. But his sense of smell jabbered at him urgently, and\nAtiaran was dashing straight toward the copse. He sprinted after her.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>She stopped short just on the east\nside of the trees. Quivering feverishly, she glared about her with an\nexpression of terror and hatred, as if she wanted to enter the copse and did\nnot have the courage. Then she cried out, aghast, &quot;Waynhim? Melenkurion! Ah,\nby the Seven, what evil!&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>When Covenant reached her side,\nshe was staring a silent scream at the trees. She held her hands clasped\ntogether at her mouth, and her shoulders shook.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>As soon as he looked at the copse,\nhe saw a thin path leading into it. Impulsively, he moved forward, plunged\nbetween the trees. In five steps, he was in an open space much like the other\nWaymeets he had seen. This chamber was round, but it had the same tree walls,\nbranch-woven roof, beds, and shelves.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>But the walls were spattered with\nblood, and a figure lay in the center of the floor. Covenant gasped as he saw\nthat the figure was not human.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Its outlines were generally\nmanlike, though the torso was inordinately long, and the limbs were short,\nmatched in length, indicating that the creature could both stand erect and run\non its hands and feet. But the face was entirely alien to Covenant. A long,\nflexible neck joined the hairless head to the body; two pointed ears perched\nnear the top of the skull on either side'; the mouth was as thin as a mere slit\nin the flesh. And there were no eyes. Two gaping nostrils surrounded by a\nthick, fleshy membrane filled the center of the face. The head had no other\nfeatures.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Driven through the center of the\ncreature's chest -pinning it to the ground-was a long iron spike.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The chamber stank of violence so\nbadly that in a few breaths Covenant felt about to suffocate. He wanted to\nflee. He was a leper; even dead things were dangerous to him. But he forced\nhimself to remain still while he sorted out one impression. On seeing the\ncreature, his first thought had been that the Land was rid of something\nloathsome. But as he gritted himself, his eyes and nose corrected him. The\nwrongness which assailed his senses came from the killing from the spike-not\nfrom the creature. Its flesh had a hue of ravaged health; it had been natural,\nright-a proper part of the life of the Land Gagging on the stench of the crime,\nCovenant turned and fled.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>As he broke out into the sunlight,\nhe saw Atiaran already moving away to the north, almost out of the hollow. He\nneeded no urging to hurry after her; his bones ached to put as much distance as\npossible between himself and the desecrated Waymeet. He hastened in her\ndirection as if there were fangs snapping at his heels.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>For the rest of the day, he found\nrelief in putting leagues behind him. The edge of the unnatural smell was\nslowly blunted as they hurried onward. But it did not fade below a certain\nlevel. When he and Atiaran were forced by fatigue and darkness to stop for the\nnight, he felt sure that there was uneasiness still ahead -that the killer of\nthe Waynhim was moving invidiously to the north of them. Atiaran seemed to\nshare his conviction; she asked him if he knew how to use the knife he carried.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>After sleep had eluded him for\nsome time, he made himself ask her, &quot;Shouldn't we have-buried it?&quot;\nShe answered softly from her shadowed bed across the low light of the\ngraveling, &quot;They would not thank our interference. They will take care of\ntheir own. But the fear is on me that they may break their bond with the Lords\nbecause of this.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>That thought gave Covenant a chill\nhe could not explain, and he lay sleepless for half the night under the cold\nmockery of the stars.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The next day dawned on short\nrations for the travelers. Atiaran had been planning to replenish her supplies\nat a Waymeet the previous day, so now she had no springwine left and little\nbread or staples. However, they were in no danger of going hungry\n-treasure-berries were plentiful along their path. But they had to start without\nwarm food to steady them after the cold, uncomforting night. And they had to\ntravel in the same direction that the killer of the Waynhim had taken. Covenant\nfound himself stamping angrily into the dawn as if he sensed that the murder\nhad been intended for him. For the first time in several days, he allowed\nhimself to think of Drool and Lord Foul. He knew that either of them was\ncapable of killing a Waynhim, even of killing it gratuitously. And the\nDespiser, at least, might easily know where he was.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>But the day passed without mishap.\nThe dim, constant uneasiness in the air grew no worse and aliantha abounded. As\nthe leagues passed, Covenant's anger lost its edge. He relaxed into\ncontemplation of the health around him, looked with undiminished wonder at the trees,\nthe magisterial oaks and dignified elms, the comforting spread of the Gilden,\nthe fine filigree of the mimosas, the spry saplings of wattle -and at the calm\nold contours of the hills, lying like slumberous heads to the reclining earth\nof the western plains.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Such things gave him a new sense\nof the pulse and pause, the climbing sap and the still rock of the Land. In\ncontrast, the trailing ordure of death seemed both petty insignificant beside\nthe vast abundant vitality of the hills-and vile, like an act of cruelty done\nto a child.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The next morning, Atiaran changed\nher course, veering somewhat eastward, so that she and Covenant climbed more\nand more into the heart of the hills. They took a crooked trail, keeping\nprimarily to valleys</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>that wandered generally northward\nbetween the hills. And when the sun was low enough to cast the eastern\nhillsides into shadow, the travelers came in sight of Soaring Woodhelven.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Their approach gave Covenant a\ngood view of the tree village from some distance away across a wide glade. He\njudged the tree to be nearly four hundred feet high, and a good thirty broad at\nthe base. There were no branches on the trunk until forty or fifty feet above\nthe ground, then abruptly huge limbs spread out horizontally from the stem,\nforming in outline a half-oval with a flattened tip. The whole tree was so\nthickly branched and leaved that most of the village was hidden; but Covenant\ncould see a few ladders between the branches and along the trunk; and in some\ntight knots on the limbs he thought he could make out the shapes of dwellings.\nIf any people were moving through the foliage, they were -so well camouflaged\nthat he could not discern them.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;That is Soaring\nWoodhelven,&quot; said Atiaran, &quot;a home for the people of the lillianrill,\nas Mithil Stonedown is a home for those of the rhadhamaerl. I have been here\nonce, on my returning from the Loresraat. The Woodhelvennin are a comely folk,\nthough I do not understand their wood-lore. They will give us rest and food,\nand perhaps help as well. It is said, `Go to the rhadhamaerl for truth, and the\nlillianrill for counsel.' My need for counsel is sore upon me. Come.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>She led Covenant across the glade\nto the base of the great tree. They had to pass around the roughbarked trunk to\nthe northwest curve, and there they found a large natural opening in the hollow\nstem. The inner cavity was not deep; it was only large enough to hold a spiral\nstairway. Above the first thick limb was another opening, from which ladders\nbegan their way upward.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The sight gave Covenant a quiver\nof his old fear of heights, almost forgotten since his ordeal on the stairs of\nKevin's Watch. He did not want to have to climb those ladders.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>But it appeared that he would not\nhave to climb. The opening to the trunk was barred with a heavy wooden gate,\nand there was no one to open it. In fact, the whole place seemed too quiet and\ndark for a human habitation. Dusk was gathering, but no home glimmers broke\nthrough the overhanging shadow,</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>and no gloaming calls between\nfamilies interrupted the silence.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant glanced at Atiaran, and\nsaw that she was puzzled. Resting her hands on the bars of the gate, she said,\n&quot;This is not well, Thomas Covenant. When last I came here, there were\nchildren in the glade, people on the stair, and no gate at the door. Something\nis amiss. And yet I sense no great evil. There is no more ill here than\nelsewhere along our path.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Stepping back from the gate, she\nraised her head and called, &quot;Hail! Soaring Woodhelven! We are travelers,\npeople of the Land! Our way is long-our future dark! What has become of\nyou?&quot; When no answering shout came, she went on in exasperation, &quot;I\nhave been here before! In those days, it was said that Woodhelvennin\nhospitality had no equal! Is this your friendship to the Land?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Suddenly, they heard a light scattering\nfall behind them. Spinning around, they found themselves encircled by seven or\neight men gripping smooth wooden daggers. Instinctively, Atiaran and Covenant\nbacked away. As the men advanced, one of them said, &quot;The meaning of\nfriendship changes with the times. We have seen darkness, and heard dark\ntidings. We will be sure of strangers&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>A torch flared in the hands of the\nman who had spoken. Through the glare, Covenant got his first look at the\nWoodhelvennin. They were all tall, slim, and lithe, with fair hair and light\neyes. They dressed in cloaks of woodland colors, and the fabric seemed to cling\nto their limbs, as if to avoid snagging on branches. Each man held a pointed\ndagger of polished wood which gleamed dully in the torchlight.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant was at a loss, but\nAtiaran gathered her robe about her and answered with stern pride, &quot;Then\nbe sure. I am Atiaran Trell-mate of Mithil Stonedown. This is Thomas Covenant,\nUnbeliever and message-bearer to the Lords. We come in friendship and need,\nseeking safety and help. I did not know that it is your custom to make\nstrangers prisoner.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The man who held the torch stepped\nforward and bowed seriously. &quot;When we are sure, we will ask your pardon.\nUntil that time, you must come with me to a place where you may be examined. We\nhave seen strange tokens, and see more now.&quot; He nodded at Covenant.\n&quot;`We would make no mistake, either in trust or in doubt. Will you\naccompany me?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Very well,&quot; Atiaran\nsighed. &quot;But you would not be treated so in Mithil Stonedown.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The man replied, &quot;Let the\nStonedownors taste our troubles before they despise our caution. Now, come\nbehind me.&quot; He moved forward to open the gate.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>At the command, Covenant balked.\nHe was not prepared to go climbing around a tall tree in the dark. It would\nhave been bad enough in the light, when he could have seen what he was doing,\nbut the very thought of taking the risk at night made his pulse hammer in his\nforehead. Stepping away from Atiaran, he said with a quaver he could not\nrepress, &quot;Forget it.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Before he could react, two of the\nmen grabbed his arms. He tried to twist away, but they held him, pulled his\nhands up into the torchlight. For one stark moment, the Woodhelvennin stared at\nhis hand, at the ring on his left and the scar on his right-as if he were some\nkind of ghoul. Then the man with the torc snapped, &quot;Bring him.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;No!&quot; Covenant clamored.\n&quot;You don't understand. I'm not good at heights. I'll fall.&quot; As they\nwrestled him toward the gate, he shouted, &quot;Hellfire! You're trying to kill\nme!&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>His captors halted momentarily. He\nheard a series of shouts, but in his confused, angry panic he did not\nunderstand. Then the leader said, &quot;If you do not climb well, you will not\nbe asked to climb.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The next moment, the end of a rope\nfell beside Covenant. Instantly, two more men lashed his wrists to the line.\nBefore he realized what was happening, the rope sprang taut. He was hauled into\nthe air like a sack of miscellaneous helplessness.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>He thought he heard a shout of\nprotest from Atiaran, but he could not be sure. Crying silently, Bloody hell!\nhe tensed his shoulders against the strain and stared wildly up into the\ndarkness. He could not see anyone drawing up the rope in the last glimmering of\nthe torch, the line seemed to stretch up into an abyss-and that made him doubly\nafraid.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Then the light below him vanished.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The next moment, a low rustling of\nleaves told him that he had reached the level of the first branches. He saw a\nyellow glow through the upper opening of the tree's stairwell. But the rope\nhauled him on upward into the heights of the village.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>His own movements made him swing\nslightly, so that at odd intervals he brushed against the leaves.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>But that was his only contact with\nthe tree. He saw no lights, heard no voices; the deep black weights of</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>the mighty limbs slid smoothly past\nhim as if he were being dragged into the sky.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Soon both his shoulders throbbed\nsharply, and his arms went numb. With his head craned upward, he gaped into a\nlightless terror and moaned as if he were drowning, Hellfire! Ahh!</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Then without warning his movement\nstopped. Before he could brace himself, a torch flared, and he found himself\nlevel with three men who were standing on a limb. In the sudden light, they\nlooked identical to the men who had captured him, but one of them had a small\ncirclet of leaves about his head. The other two considered Covenant for a\nmoment, then reached out and gripped his shirt, pulling him toward their limb.\nAs the solid branch struck his feet, the rope slackened; letting his arms drop.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>His wrists were still tied\ntogether, but he tried to get a hold on one of the men, keep himself from\nfalling off the limb. His arms were dead; he could not move them. The darkness\nstretched below him like a hungry beast. With a gasp, he lunged toward the men,\nstriving to make them save him. They grappled him roughly. He refused to bear\nhis own weight, forced them to carry and drag him down the limb until they came\nto a wide gap in the trunk. There the center of the stem was hollowed out to\nform a large chamber, and Covenant dropped heavily to the floor, shuddering\nwith relief.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Shortly, a rising current of\nactivity began around him. He paid no attention to it; he kept his eyes shut to\nconcentrate on the hard stability of the floor, and on the pain of blood\nreturning to his hands and arms. The hurt was excruciating, but he endured it\nin clenched silence. Soon his hands were tingling, and his fingers felt thick,\nhot. He flexed them, curled them into claws. Through his teeth, he muttered to\nthe fierce rhythm of his heart, Hellfire. Hell and blood.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>He opened his eyes.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>He was lying on polished wood at\nthe center of the myriad concentric circles of the tree trunk. The age rings\nmade the rest of the room seem to focus toward him as if he were sprawled on a\ntarget. His arms felt unnaturally inarticulate, but he forced them to thrust\nhim into a sitting position. Then he looked at his hands. His wrists were raw\nfrom the cut of the rope, but they were not bleeding.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Bastards!</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>He raised his head and glowered\naround him.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The chamber was about twenty feet\nwide, and seemed to fill the whole inside diameter of the trunk. The only\nopening was the one through which he had stumbled, and he could see darkness\noutside; but the room was brightly lit by torches set into the walls-torches\nwhich burned smokelessly, and did not appear to be consumed. The polished walls\ngleamed as if they were burnished, but the ceiling, high above the floor, was\nrough, untouched wood.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Five Woodhelvennin stood around\nCovenant in the hollow-three men, including the one wearing the circlet of\nleaves, and two women. They all were dressed in similar cloaks which clung to\ntheir outlines, though the colors varied, and all were taller than Covenant.\nTheir tallness seemed threatening, so he got slowly to his feet, lowering the\npack from his shoulders as he stood.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>A moment later, the man who had\nled Covenant's captors on the ground entered the chamber, followed by Atiaran.\nShe appeared unharmed, but weary and depressed, as though the climb and the\ndistrust had sapped her strength. When she saw Covenant, she moved to take her\nstand beside him.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>One of the women said, &quot;Only\ntwo, Soranal?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Yes,&quot; Atiaran's guard\nanswered. &quot;We watched, and there were no others as they crossed the south\nglade. And our scouts have not reported any other strangers in the hills.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Scouts?&quot; asked Atiaran.\n&quot;I did not know that scouts were needed among the people of the\nLand.&quot; The woman took a step forward and replied, &quot;Atiaran\nTrell-mate, the folk of Mithil Stonedown have been known to us since our return\nto the Land in the new age. And there are those among us who remember your\nvisit here. We know our friends, and the value of friendship.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Then in what way have we\ndeserved this treatment?&quot; Atiaran demanded. &quot;We came in search of\nfriends.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The woman did not answer Atiaran's\nquestion directly. &quot;Because we are all people of the Land,&quot; she said,\n&quot;and because our peril is a peril for all, I will attempt to ease the\nsting of our discourtesy by explaining our actions. We in this heartwood\nchamber are the Heers of Soaring Woodhelven, the leaders of our people. I am\nLlaura daughter of Annamar. Here also&quot;-she indicated each individual with\na nod &quot;are Omournil daughter of Mournil, Soranal son of Thiller, Padrias\nson of Mill, Malliner son of Veinnin, and Baradakas, Hirebrand of the lillianrill.&quot;\nThis last was the man wearing the circlet of leaves. &quot;We made the decision\nof distrust, and will give our reasons.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;I see that you are\nimpatient.&quot; A taste of bitterness roughened her voice. &quot;Well, I will\nnot tire you with the full tale of the blighting wind which has blown over us\nfrom time to time from Gravin Threndor. I will not describe the angry storms,\nor show you the body of the three-winged bird that died atop our Woodhelven, or\ndiscuss the truth of the rumors of murder which have reached our ears. By the Seven!\nThere are angry songs that should be sung-but I will not sing them now. This I\nwill tell you: all servants of the Gray Slayer are not dead. It is our belief\nthat a Raver has been among us.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>That name carried a pang of danger\nthat made Covenant look rapidly about him, trying to locate the peril. For an\ninstant, he did not comprehend. But then he noticed how Atiaran stiffened at\nLlaura's words-saw the jumping knot at the corner of her jaw, felt the\nheightened fear in her, though she said nothing-and he understood. The\nWoodhelvennin feared that he and she might be Ravers.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Without thinking, he snapped,\n&quot;That's ridiculous.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The Heers ignored him. After a\nshort pause, Soranal continued Llaura's explanation. &quot;Two days past, in\nthe high sun of afternoon, when our people were busy at their crafts and\nlabors, and the children were playing in the upper branches of the Tree, a\nstranger came to Soaring Woodhelven. Two days earlier, the last ill storm out\nof Mount Thunder had broken suddenly and turned into good-and on the day the\nstranger came our hearts were glad, thinking that a battle we knew not of had\nbeen won for the Land. He wore the appearance of a Stonedownor, and said his\nname was Jehannum. We welcomed him with the hospitality which is the joy of the\nLand. We saw no reason to doubt him, though the children shrank from him with\nunwonted cries and fears. Alas for us-the young saw more clearly than the old.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;He passed among us with dark\nhints and spite in his mouth, casting sly ridicule on our crafts and customs.\nAnd we could not answer him. But we remembered Peace, and did nothing for a\nday.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;In that time, Jehannum's\nhints turned to open foretelling of doom. So at last we called him to the\nheartwood chamber and the meeting of the Heers. We heard the words he chose to\nspeak, words full of</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>glee and the reviling of the Land.\nThen our eyes saw more deeply, and we offered him the test of the\nlomillialor.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;You know of the High Wood,\nlomillialor-do you not, Atiaran?&quot; Baradakas spoke for the first time.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;There is much in it like the\norcrest of the rhadhamaerl. It is an offspring of the One Tree, from which the\nStaff of Law itself was made.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;But we had no chance to make\nthe test,&quot; Soranal resumed. &quot;When Jehannum saw the High Wood, he\nsprang away from us and escaped. We gave pursuit, but he had taken us by\nsurprise-we were too full of quiet, not ready for such evils-and his fleetness\nfar surpassed ours. He eluded us, and made his way toward the east.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>He sighed as he concluded,\n&quot;In the one day which has passed since that time, we have begun relearning\nthe defense of the Land.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>After a moment, Atiaran said\nquietly, &quot;I hear you. Pardon my anger -I spoke in haste and ignorance. But\nsurely now you can see that we are no friends of the Gray Slayer.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;We see much in you, Atiaran\nTrell-mate,&quot; said Llaura, her eyes fixed keenly on the Stonedownor,\n&quot;much sorrow and much courage. But your companion is closed to us. It may\nbe that we will need to emprison this Thomas Covenant.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Melenkurion!&quot; hissed\nAtiaran. &quot;Do not dare! Do you not know? Have you not looked at him?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>At this, a murmur of relief passed\namong the Heers, a murmur which accented their tension. Stepping toward\nAtiaran, Soranal extended his right hand, palm forward, in the salute of\nwelcome, and said, &quot;We have looked-looked and heard. We trust you, Atiaran\nTrell-mate. You have spoken a name which no Raver would call upon to save a\ncompanion.&quot; He took her by the arm and drew her away from Covenant, out of\nthe center of the chamber.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Without her at his shoulder,\nCovenant felt suddenly exposed, vulnerable. For the first time, he sensed how\nmuch he had come to depend upon her presence, her guidance, if not her support.\nBut he was in no mood to meet threats passively. He poised himself on the balls\nof his feet, ready to move in any direction; and his eyes shifted quickly\namong, the faces that stared at him from the gleaming walls of the chamber.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Jehannum predicted many\nthings,&quot; said Llaura, &quot;but one especially you should be told. He said\nthat a great evil in the semblance of Berek Halfhand walked the hills toward us\nout of the south. And here-&quot; She pointed a pale arm at Covenant, her voice\nrising sternly as she spoke. &quot;Here is an utter stranger to the Land-half\nunhanded on his right, and on his left bearing a ring of white gold. Beyond\ndoubt carrying messages to the Lords-messages of doom!&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>With a pleading intensity, Atiaran\nsaid, &quot;Do not presume to judge. Remember the Oath. You are not Lords. And\ndark words may be warnings as well as prophecies. Will you trust the word of a\nRaver?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Baradakas shrugged slightly.\n&quot;It is not the message we judge. Our test is for the man.&quot; Reaching\nbehind him, he lifted up a smooth wooden rod three feet long from which all the\nbark had been stripped. He held it by the middle gently, reverently. &quot;This\nis lomillialor.&quot; As he said the name, the wood glistened as if its clear\ngrain were moist with dew.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>What the hell is this? Covenant\ntried to balance himself for whatever was coming.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>But the Hirebrand's next move\ncaught him by surprise. Baradakas swung his rod and lofted it toward the\nUnbeliever.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>He jerked aside and clutched at\nthe lomillialor with his right hand. But he did not have enough fingers to get\na quick grip on it; it slipped away from him, dropped to the floor with a\nwooden click that seemed unnaturally loud in the hush of the chamber.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>For an instant, everyone remained\nstill, frozen while they absorbed the meaning of what they had seen. Then, in\nunison, the Heers uttered their verdict with all the finality of a death\nsentence.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;The High Wood rejects him.\nHe is a wrong in the Land.&quot;<br clear=all style='page-break-before:always'>\n</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><a name=\"_Toc370739015\"><span class=Heading1Char><span\nstyle='font-size:16.0pt;line-height:105%'>TEN: The Celebration of Spring</span></span></a></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>In one fluid motion, Baradakas\ndrew a club from his cloak and raised it as he moved toward Covenant. Covenant\nreacted instinctively, defensively. Before the Hirebrand could reach him, he\nstooped and snatched up the lomillialor rod with his left hand. As Baradakas\nswung the club at his head, he slashed the Hirebrand's arm with the rod.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>In a shower of white sparks, the\nclub sprang into splinters. Baradakas was flung back as if he had been blasted away\nby an explosion.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The force of the hit vibrated\nthrough Covenant's hand to his elbow, and his fingers were struck momentarily\nnumb. The rod started to slip from his hand. He gaped at it, thinking, What the\nhell-?</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>But then the mute astonishment of\nthe Heers, and the Hirebrand's crumpled form, steadied him. Test me? he rasped.\nBastards. He took the rod in his right hand, holding it by the middle as\nBaradakas had done. Its glistening wood felt slick; it gave him a sensation of\nslippage, as if it were oozing from his grasp, though the wood did not actually\nmove. As he gripped it, he glared around at the Heers, put all the anger their\ntreatment had sparked in him into his gaze. &quot;Now why don't you tell me one\nmore time about how this thing rejects me.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Soranal and Llaura stood on either\nside of Atiaran, with Malliner opposite them against the wall. Omournil and\nPadrias were bent over the fallen Hirebrand. As Covenant surveyed them, Atiaran\nfaced him grimly. &quot;In the older age,&quot; she said, &quot;when High Lord\nKevin trusted the Gray Slayer, he was given priceless gifts of orcrest and\nlomillialor. The tale says that these gifts were soon lost-but while the Gray\nSlayer possessed them they did not reject him. It is possible for Despite to\nwear the guise of truth. Perhaps the wild magic surpasses truth.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Thanks a lot! Covenant glowered at\nher. What're you trying to do to me?</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>In a pale voice, Llaura replied,\n&quot;That is the tale. But we are only Woodhelvennin-not Lords. Such matters\nare beyond us. Never in the memory of our people has a test of truth struck\ndown a Hirebrand of</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>the lillianrill. What is the song?\n`he will save or damn the Earth.' Let us pray that we will not find damnation\nfor our distrust.&quot; Extending an unsteady hand toward Covenant in the\nsalute of welcome, she said, &quot;Hail, Unbeliever! Pardon our doubts, and be\nwelcome in Soaring Woodhelven.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>For an instant, Covenant faced her\nwith a bitter retort twisting his lips. But he found when he met her eyes that\nhe could see the sincerity of her apology. The perception abashed his\nvehemence. With conflicting intentions, he muttered, &quot;Forget it.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Llaura and Soranal both bowed as\nif he had accepted her apology. Then they turned to watch as Baradakas climbed\ndazedly to his feet. His hands pulled at his face as if it were covered with\ncobwebs, but he assured Omournil and Padrias that he was unharmed. With a\nmixture of wonder and dismay in his eyes, he also saluted Covenant.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant responded with a dour\nnod. He did not wait for the Hirebrand to ask; he handed the lomillialor to\nBaradakas, and was glad to be rid of its disquieting, insecure touch.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Baradakas received the rod and\nsmiled at it crookedly, as if it had witnessed his defeat. Then he slipped it\naway into his cloak. Turning his smile toward Covenant, he said,\n&quot;Unbeliever, our presences are no longer needed here. You have not eaten,\nand the weariness of your journey lies heavily upon you. Will you accept the\nhospitality of my house?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The invitation surprised Covenant;\nfor a moment he hesitated, trying to decide whether or not he could trust the\nHirebrand. Baradakas appeared calm, unhostile, but his smile was more complex\nthan Llaura's apology. But then Covenant reflected that if the question were\none of trust, he would be safer with Baradakas alone than with all the Heers together.\nStiffly, he said, &quot;You honor me.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The Hirebrand bowed. &quot;In\naccepting a gift you honor the giver.&quot; He looked around at the other\nWoodhelvennin, and when they nodded their approval, he turned and moved out of\nthe heartwood chamber.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant glanced toward Atiaran,\nbut she was already talking softly to Soranal. Without further delay, he\nstepped out onto the broad limb beside Baradakas.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The night over the great tree was\nnow scattered with lights-the home fires of the Woodhelvennin. They illuminated\nthe fall far down through the branches, but did not reach to the ground.\nInvoluntarily, Covenant clutched at Baradakas' shoulder.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;It is not far,&quot; the\nHirebrand said softly. &quot;Only up to the next limb. I will come behind\nyou-you will not fall.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Cursing silently through his\nteeth, Covenant gripped the rungs of the ladder. He wanted to retreat, go back\nto the solidity of the heartwood chamber, but pride and anger prevented him.\nAnd the rungs felt secure, almost adhesive, to his fingers. When Baradakas\nplaced a reassuring hand on his back, he started awkwardly upward.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>As Baradakas had promised, the\nnext limb was not far away. Soon Covenant reached another broad branch. A few\nsteps out from the trunk, it forked, and in the fork sat the Hirebrand's home.\nHolding Baradakas' shoulders for support, he gained the doorway, crossed the\nthreshold as if he were being blown in by a gust of relief.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>He was in a neat, two-roomed\ndwelling formed entirely from the branches of the tree. Interwoven limbs</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>made part of the floor and all the\nwalls, including the partition between the rooms. And the ceiling was a dome of\ntwigs and leaves. Along one wall of the first room, broad knees of wood grew\ninto the chamber like chairs, and a bunk hung opposite them. The place had a\nwarm, clean atmosphere, an ambience of devotion to lore, that Covenant found\nfaintly disturbing, like a reminder that the Hirebrand could be a dangerous\nman.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>While Covenant scanned the room,\nBaradakas set torches in each of the outer walls and lit them by rubbing his\nhands over their ends and murmuring softly. Then he rummaged around in the far\nroom for a moment, and returned carrying a tray laden with slabs of bread and\ncheese, a large bunch of grapes, and a wooden jug. He set a small, three-legged\ntable between two of the chairs, put the tray on it, and motioned for Covenant\nto sit down.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>At the sight of the food, Covenant\ndiscovered that he was hungry; he had eaten nothing but aliantha for the past\ntwo days. He watched while Baradakas bowed momentarily over the food. Then he\nseated himself. Following his host's example, he made sandwiches with cheese\nand grapes between slices of fresh bread, and helped himself liberally to the\njug of springwine. In the first rush of eating, he said nothing, saving his\nattention for the food.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>But he did not forget who his host\nwas, what had happened between them.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Leaving the springwine with\nCovenant, Baradakas cleared away the remains of the meal. When he returned\nafter storing his food in the far room, he said, &quot;Now, Unbeliever. In what\nother way may I give you comfort?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant took a deep draft of\nspringwine, then replied as casually as he could, &quot;Give an answer. You\nwere ready to split my head open-back there. And it looked as if you got quite\na jolt from that-from that High Wood. Why did you invite me here?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>For a moment, Baradakas hesitated,\nas if pondering how much he should say. Then he reached into his back room,\npicked up a smooth staff nearly six feet long, and sat down on the bed across\nfrom Covenant. As he spoke, he began polishing the white wood of the staff with\na soft cloth. &quot;There are many reasons, Thomas Covenant. You required a\nplace to sleep, and my home is nearer to the heartwood chamber than any\nother-for one who dislikes heights. And neither you nor I are necessary for the\nconsideration of counsel and help which will be done this night. Atiaran knows\nthe Land-she will say all that need be said concerning your journey. And both\nSoranal and Llaura are able to give any help she may ask.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>As he looked 'across the room at\nthe Hirebrand's working hands and light, penetrating eyes, Covenant had the odd\nfeeling that his test had been resumed that the encounter of the lomillialor\nhad only begun Baradakas' examining. But the springwine unknotted his fears and\ntensions; he was not anxious. Steadily, he said, &quot;Tell me more.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;I also intended that my\noffer of hospitality should be an apology. I was prepared to injure you, and\nthat violation of my Oath of Peace needs reparation. Had you shown yourself to\nbe a servant of the Gray Slayer, it would have sufficed to capture you. And\ninjury might have deprived the Lords of a chance to examine you. So in that way\nI was wrong. And became more wrong still when you lifted the lomillialor, and\nits fire struck me. I hope to amend my folly.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant recognized the\nHirebrand's frankness, but his sense of being probed sharpened rather than\nfaded. He held his host's eyes as he said, &quot;You still haven't answered my\nquestion.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>In an unsurprised tone, Baradakas\ncountered, &quot;Are there other reasons? What do you see in me?&quot;\n&quot;You're still testing me,&quot; Covenant growled.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The Hirebrand nodded slowly.\n&quot;Perhaps. Perhaps I am.&quot; He got to his feet and braced one end of the\nstaff against the floor as he gave a last touch to its polish. Then he said,\n&quot;See, Thomas Covenant-I have made a staff for you. When I began it, I\nbelieved it was for myself. But now I know otherwise. Take it. I may serve you\nwhen help and counsel fail.&quot; To the brief question in Covenant's eyes, he\nreplied, &quot;No, this is not High Wood. But it is good nonetheless. Let me\ngive it to you.&quot; Covenant shook his head. &quot;Finish your testing.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Suddenly, Baradakas raised the\nstaff and struck the wood under his feet a hard blow. For an instant, the\nentire limb shook as if a gale had come up; the smaller branches thrashed, and\nthe dwelling tossed like a chip on an angry wave. Covenant feared that the tree\nwas falling, and he gripped his chair in apprehension. But almost immediately\nthe violence passed. Baradakas leveled his pale eyes at Covenant and whispered,\n&quot;Then hear me, Unbeliever. Any test of truth is no greater than the one\nwho gives it. And I have felt your power. In all the memory of the lillianrill,\nno Hirebrand has ever been struck by the High Wood. We are the friends of the\nOne Tree, not its foes. But beside you I am as weak as a child. I cann force\nthe truth from you. In spite of my testing, you might be the Gray Slayer\nhimself, come to turn all the life of the Land to ashes.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Incensed by the suggestion,\nCovenant spat, &quot;That's ridiculous.&quot; Baradakas stepped closer, drove\nhis probing gaze deep into Covenant's eyes. Covenant squirmed; he could feel\nthe Hirebrand exploring parts of him that he wanted to protect, keep hidden.\nWhat has that bastard Foul to do with me? he demanded bitterly. I didn't\nexactly choose to be his errand boy.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Abruptly, Baradakas' eyes widened,\nand he fell back across the room as if he had seen something of astonishing\npower. He caught himself on the bed, sat there for a moment while he watched\nhis hands tremble on the staff. Then he said carefully, &quot;True. One day I\nmay be wise enough to know what can be relied upon. Now I need time to\nunderstand. I trust you, my friend. At the last trial, you will not abandon us\nto death.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Here.&quot; He proffered the\nstaff again. &quot;Will you not accept my gift?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant did not reply at once. He\nwas trembling also, and he had to clench himself before he could say without a\ntremor, &quot;Why? Why do you trust me?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The Hirebrand's eyes gleamed as if\nhe were on the verge of tears, but he was smiling as he said, &quot;You are a\nman who knows the value of beauty.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant stared at that answer for\na moment, then looked away. A complex shame came over him; he felt unclean,\ntainted, in the face of Baradakas' trust. But then he stiffened. Keep moving.\nSurvive. What does trust have to do with it? Brusquely, he reached out and\naccepted the staff.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>It felt pure in his hands, as if\nit had been shaped from the healthiest wood by the most loving devotion. He\ngripped it, scrutinized it, as if it could provide him with the innocence he lacked.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>A short time later, he surprised\nhimself with a wide yawn. He had not realized that he was so tired. He tried to\nsuppress his weariness, but the effort only produced another yawn.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Baradakas responded with a kindly\nsmile. He left the bed and motioned for Covenant to lie down. Covenant had no\nintention of going to sleep, but as soon as he was horizontal, all the\nspringwine he had consumed seemed to rush to his head, and he felt himself\ndrifting on the high tree breeze. Soon he was fast in slumber.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>He slept soundly, disturbed only\nby the memory of the Hirebrand's intense, questioning eyes, and by the\nsensation that the lomillialor was slipping through his fingers, no matter how\nhard he clenched it. When he awoke the next morning, his arms ached as if he had\nbeen grappling with an angel all night.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Opening his eyes, he found Atiaran\nsitting across the room from him, waiting. As soon as she saw that he was\nawake, she stood and moved closer to him. &quot;Come, Thomas Covenant,&quot;\nshe said. &quot;Already we have lost the dawn of this day.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant studied her for a moment.\nThe background of her face held a deepening shadow of fatigue, and he guessed\nthat she had spent much of the night talking with the Heers. But she seemed\nsomehow comforted by what she had shared and heard, and the brightness of her\nglance was almost optimistic. Perhaps she now had some sort of hope.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>He approved of anything that might\nreduce her hostility toward him, and he swung out of bed as if he shared her\noptimism. Despite the soreness of his arms, he felt remarkably refreshed, as if\nthe ambience of the Woodhelven had been exerting its hospitality, its\nbeneficence, to help him rest. Moving briskly, he washed his face, dried\nhimself on a thick towel of leaves, then checked himself for injuries and adjusted\nhis clothing. A loaf lay on the threelegged table, and when he broke off a hunk\nfor his breakfast, he found that it was made of bread and meat baked together.\nMunching it, he went to look out one of the windows.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Atiaran joined him, and together\nthey gazed through the branches northward. In the far distance, they saw a\nriver running almost directly east, and beyond it the hills spread on to the\nhorizon. But something more than the river separated these northern hills from\nthose beside which the travelers had been walking since they had left Mithil\nStonedown. The land beyond the river seemed to ripple in the morning sunshine,\nas if the quiet earth were flowing over shoals-as if there -the secret rock of\nthe Land ruffled the surface, revealing itself to those who could read it. From\nhis high Woodhelven vantage, Covenant felt he was seeing something that\nsurpassed even his new perceptions.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;There,&quot; said Atiaran\nsoftly, as if she were speaking of a holy place, &quot;there is Andelain. The\nHirebrand has chosen his home well for such a view. Here the Mithil River runs\neast before turning north again toward Gravin Threndor and the Soulsease. And\nbeyond are the Andelainian Hills, the hearthealing richness of the Land. Ali,\nCovenant, the seeing of them gives me courage. And Soranal has taught me a path\nwhich may make possible my fondest dream- With good fortune and good speed, we\nmay see that which will turn much of my folly to wisdom. We must go. Are you\nprepared?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>No, Covenant thought. Not to go\nclimbing around this tree. But he nodded. Atiaran had brought his pack to him,\nand while she stepped out of the Hirebrand's home onto the broad branch, he\npulled the straps onto his shoulders, ignoring the ache of his arms. Then he\ntook up the staff Baradakas had given him, and braced himself to risk his neck\non the descent of the Woodhelven.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The trunk was only three or four\nsteps away, but the two-hundred-foot drop to the ground made him</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>freeze, hesitate apprehensively\nwhile the first reels of vertigo gnawed at his resolve. But as he stood in the\nHirebrand's doorway, he heard the shouting of young voices, and saw children\nscampering through the branches overhead. Some of them pursued others, and in\nthe chase they sprang from limb to limb as blithely as if the fall were\nhelpless to hurt them.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The next instant, two children, a\nboy and a girl, dropped onto the limb before Covenant from a branch nearly\ntwenty feet above. The girl was in merry pursuit of the boy, but he eluded her\ntouch and darted around behind Covenant. From this covert, he shouted\ngleefully, &quot;Safe! Chase another! I am safe!&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Without thinking, Covenant said,\n&quot;He's safe.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The girl laughed, faked a lunge\nforward, and sprang away after someone else. At once, the boy dashed to the\ntrunk and scurried up the ladder toward higher playgrounds.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant took a deep breath,\nclutched the staff for balance, and stepped away from the door. Teetering\nawkwardly, he struggled to the relative safety of the trunk.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>After that, he felt better. When\nhe slid the staff through his pack straps, he could grip the ladder with both\nhands, and then the secure touch of the rungs reassured him. Before he had\ncovered half the distance, his heart was no longer pounding, and he was able to\ntrust his hold enough to look about him at the dwellings and people he passed.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Finally, he reached the lowest\nbranches, and followed Atiaran down the stair to the ground. There the Heers\nwere gathered to say their farewells. When he saw Baradakas, Covenant took the\nstaff in his hands to show that he had not forgotten it, and grimaced in\nresponse to the Hirebrand's smile.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Well, message-bearers,&quot;\nsaid Llaura after a pause, &quot;you have told us that the fate of the Land is\non your shoulders, and we believe. It sorrows us that we cannot ease the\nburden-but we judge that no one can take your place in this matter. What little\nhelp we can give we have given. All which remains for us is to defend our\nhomes, and to pray for you. We wish you good speed for the sake of all the\nLand. And fo your own sake we urge you to be in time for the Celebration. There\nare great omens of hope for any who view that festival.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Atiaran Trell-mate, go in\nPeace and fealty. Remember the path Soranal taught you, and do not turn aside.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Thomas Covenant, Unbeliever\nand stranger to the Land-be true. In the hour of darkness, remember the\nHirebrand's staff. Now be on your way.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Atiaran replied as formally as if\nshe were completing a ritual. &quot;We go, remembering Soaring Woodhelven for\nhome and help and hope.&quot; She bowed, touching her palms to her forehead and\nthen spreading her arms wide. Uncertainly, Covenant followed her example. The\nHeers returned the heart-opening gesture of farewell with ceremonial\ndeliberateness. Then Atiaran strode off northward, and Covenant scudded along\nbehind her like a leaf in the wake of her determination.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Neither of them looked back. The\nrest and restoration of the fair tree village made them brisk, gave them a\nforward air. They were both in their separate ways eager for Andelain, and they\nknew that Jehannum had left Soaring Woodhelven toward the east, not the north.\nThey hastened ahead among the richening hills, and reached the banks of the\nMithil River early that afternoon.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>They crossed by wading a wide\nshallows. Before she entered the water, Atiaran removed her sandals,</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>and some half conscious insight\nurged Covenant to take off his boots and socks, roll up his pant legs. As he\nsmelled the first lush scents of the Hills, he felt somehow that he needed to\nwade the Mithil barefoot in order to be ready, that the foot-washing of the\nstream was necessary to transubstantiate his flesh into the keener essence of\nAndelain. And when he stepped onto the north bank, he found that he could feel\nits vitality through his feet; now even his soles were sensitive to the Land's\nhealth.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>He so liked the strong sensation\nof the Hills under his toes that he was loath to put his boots back on, but he\ndenied himself that pleasure so that he would be able to keep up with Atiaran's\npace. Then he followed her along the path which Soranal had taught her-an easy\nway through the center of Andelain walked and wondered at the change that had\ncome over the Earth since they had crossed the river.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>He felt the change distinctly, but\nit seemed to go beyond the details which composed it. The trees were generally\ntaller and broader than their southern relations; abundant and prodigal\naliantha sometimes covered whole hillsides with viridian; the rises and vales\nluxuriated in deep aromatic grass; flowers bobbed in the breeze as\nspontaneously as if just moments before they had gaily burst from the nurture\nof the soil; small woodland animals-rabbits, squirrels, badgers, and the\nlike-scampered around, only vaguely remembering that they were wary of humans.\nBut the real difference was transcendent. The Andelainian Hills carried a purer\nimpression of health to all Covenant's senses than anything else he had\nexperienced. The aura of rightness here was so powerful that he began to regret\nhe belonged in a world where health was impalpable, indefinite, discernible\nonly by implication. For a time, he wondered how he would be able to endure\ngoing back, waking up. But the beauty of Andelain soon made him forget such\nconcerns. It was a dangerous loveliness-not because it was treacherous or\nharmful, but because it could seduce. Before long, disease, VSE, Despite,\nanger, all were forgotten, lost in the flow of health from one vista to another\naround him.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Enclosed in the Hills, surrounded\nby such tangible and specific vitality, he became more and more surprised that\nAtiaran did not wish to linger. As they hiked over the lambent terrain,\npenetrating league after league deeper into Andelain, he wanted to stop at each\nnew revelation, each new valley or avenue or dale, to savor what he saw-grip it\nwith his eyes until it was a part of him, indelible, secure against any coming\nbereavement. But Atiaran pushed on-arising early, stopping little, hurrying\nlate. Her eyes were focused far away, and the fatigue mounting behind her\nfeatures seemed unable to reach the surface.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Clearly, even these Hills paled\nfor her beside her anticipation of the unexplained &quot;Celebration.&quot;\nCovenant had no choice but to urge himself after her; her will tolerated no\ndelay.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Their second night away from\nSoaring Woodhelven was so bright and clear that they did not have to stop with\nthe setting of the sun, and Atiaran kept going until nearly midnight. After\nsupper, Covenant sat for a while looking at the sky and the piquant stars. The\naging crescent of the moon stood high in the heavens, and its white sliver sent\ndown only a suggestion of the eldritch light which had illuminated his first\nnight in the Land. Casually, he remarked, &quot;The moon'll be dark in a few\ndays.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>At that, Atiaran looked at him\nsharply, as if she suspected that he had discovered some secret of hers. But\nshe said nothing, and he did not know whether she reacted to a memory or to an\nanticipation.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The next day began as splendidly\nas the previous one. Sunshine be-gemmed the dew, sparkled like diamonds among\nthe grass and leaves; air as fresh as the Earth's first breath carried the tang\nof aliantha and larch, the fragrance of Gilden and peony, across the Hills.\nCovenant beheld such things with something like bliss in his heart, and\nfollowed Atiaran northward as if he were content. But early in the afternoon\nsomething happened which darkened all his joy, offended him to the marrow of\nhis bones. As he traveled down a natural lane between tree-thick hills, walking\nwith a fine sense of the springy grass</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>under his feet, he stepped without\nwarning on a patch of turf that felt as dangerous as a pit of quicksand.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Instinctively, he recoiled, jerked\nback three steps. At once, the threatening sensation vanished. But his nerves\nremembered it from the sole of his foot up the whole length of his leg.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>He was so surprised, so insulted,\nthat he did not think to call Atiaran. Instead, he cautiously approached the\nspot on which he had felt the danger, and touched it with one tentative toe.\nThis time, however, he felt nothing but the lush grass of Andelain. Bending\ndown, he went over the grass for a yard in all directions with his hands. But\nwhatever had fired his sense of wrongness was gone now, and after a moment of\nperplexity he started forward again. At first he took each step gingerly,\nexpecting another jolt. But the earth seemed as full of pure, resonant vitality\nas before. Shortly, he broke into a trot to catch up with Atiaran.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Toward evening, he felt the sting\nof wrong again, as if he had stepped in acid. This time, he reacted in violent\nrevulsion; he pitched forward as if diving away from a blast of lightning, and\na yell ripped past his teeth before he could stop himself. Atiaran came back to\nhim at a run, and found him pawing over the grass, tearing up the blades in\nhandfuls of outrage.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Here!&quot; he gritted,\nthumping the turf with his fist. &quot;By hell! It was here.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Atiaran blinked at him blankly. He\njumped to his feet, pointed an accusing finger at the ground. &quot;Didn't you\nfeel it? It was there. Hellfire!&quot; His finger quivered. &quot;How did you\nmiss it?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;I felt nothing,&quot; she\nreplied evenly.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>He shuddered and dropped his hand.\n&quot;It felt as if I-as if I stepped in quicksand-or acid-or&quot;-he\nremembered the slain Waynhim-&quot;or murder.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Slowly, Atiaran knelt beside the\nspot he indicated. For a moment, she studied it, then touched it with her\nhands. When she stood up, she said, &quot;I feel nothing-&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;It's gone,&quot; he\ninterrupted.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;-but I have not the touch of\na rhadhamaerl,&quot; she went on. &quot;Have you felt this before?&quot;\n&quot;Once. Earlier.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Ah,&quot; she sighed,\n&quot;would that I were a Lord, and knew what to do. There must be an evil working\ndeep in the Earth-a great evil, indeed, if the Andelainian Hills are not\naltogether safe. But the ill is new yet, or timid. It does not remain. We must\nhope to outrun it. Ah, weak! Our speed becomes less sufficient with each\npassing day.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>She pulled her robe tightly about\nher, strode away into the evening. She and Covenant traveled on without a halt\nuntil night was thick around them, and the waning moon was high in its path\namong the stars.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The next day, Covenant felt\nconvulsions of ill through the grass more often. Twice during the morning, and\nfour times during the afternoon and evening, one foot or the other recoiled\nwith sudden ferocity from the turf, and by the time Atiaran stopped for the\nnight, his nerves from his legs to the roots of his teeth were raw and\njangling. He felt intensely that such sore spots were an affront to, even a\nbetrayal of, Andelain, where every other touch and line and hue of sky and tree\nand grass and hill was redolent with</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>richness. Those attacks, pangs,\nstings made him involuntarily wary of the ground itself, as if the very\nfoundation of the Earth had been cast into doubt.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>On the fifth day since Soaring\nWoodhelven, he felt the wrongness in the grass less often, but the attacks\nshowed an increase in virulence. Shortly after noon, he found a spot of ill\nthat did not vanish after he first touched it. When he set his foot on it\nagain, he felt a quiver as if he had stepped on an ache in the groun The\nvibration rapidly numbed his foot, and his jaws hurt from clenching his teeth, but\nhe did not back away. Calling to Atiaran, he knelt on the grass and touched the\nearth's sore with his hands.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>To his surprise, he felt nothing.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Atiaran explored the ground\nherself, then considered him with a frown in her eyes. She also felt nothing.\nBut when he probed the spot with his foot, he found that the pain was still\nthere. It scraped his brain,</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>made sweat bead on his forehead,\ndrew a snarl from his throat. As the ache spread through his bones, sending\ncold numbness up his leg, he bent to slide his fingers under the sole of his\nboot. But his hands still felt nothing; only his feet were sensitive to the\nperil.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>On an impulse, he threw off one\nboot, removed his sock, and placed his bare foot on the spot of ill. This time,\nthe discrepancy was even more surprising. He could feel the pain with his\nbooted foot, but not with his bare one. And yet his sensations were perfectly\nclear; the wrong arose from the ground, not from his boot.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Before he could stop himself, he\nsnatched off his other boot and sock, and cast them away from him. Then he\ndropped heavily to sit on the grass, and clutched his throbbing head in both\nhands.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;I have no sandals for\nyou,&quot; Atiaran said stiffly. &quot;You will need footwear before this\njourney has reached its end.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant hardly heard her. He felt\nacutely that he had recognized a danger, identified a threat which had been\nwarping him for days without his knowledge.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Is that how you're going to do it,\nFoul? he snarled. First my nerves come back to life. Then Andelain makes me\nforget, Then I throw away my boots. Is that it? Break down all my defenses one\nat a time so that I won't be able to protect myself? Is that how you're going\nto destroy me?</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;We must go on,&quot; Atiaran\nsaid. &quot;Decide what you will do.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Decide? Bloody hell! Covenant\njerked himself to his feet. Fuming, he grated through his teeth, &quot;It's not\nthat easy.&quot; Then he stalked over to retrieve his boots and socks.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Survive.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>He laced his feet into his boots\nas if they were a kind of armor.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>For the rest of the day, he shied\naway from every hint of pain in the ground, and followed Atiaran grimly, with a\nclenched look in his eyes, striving against the stinging wrong to preserve his\nsovereignty, his sense of himself. And toward evening his struggle seemed to\nfind success. After a particularly vicious attack late in the afternoon, the\nill pangs stopped. He did not know whether or not they would return, but for a\nwhile at least he was free of them.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>That night was dark with clouds,\nand Atiaran was forced to make camp earlier than usual. Yet she and Covenant\ngot little rest. A light, steady rain soaked their blankets, and kept them\nawake most of the night, huddling for shelter under the deeper shadow of an\nenshrouding willow.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>But the next morning-the sixth of\ntheir journey from Soaring Woodhelven -dawned bright and full of Andelainian\ncheer. Atiaran met it with haste and anticipation in her every move; and the\nway she urged Covenant along seemed to express more friendliness, more\ncompanionship, than anything she had done since the beginning of their sojourn.\nHer desire for speed was infectious; Covenant was glad to share it because it\nrescued him from thinking about the possibility of further attacks of wrong.\nThey began the day's travel at a lope.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The day was made for traveling.\nThe air was cool, the sun clean and encouraging; the path led straight and\nlevel; springy grass carried Atiaran and Covenant forward at every stride. And\nher contagious eagerness kept him trotting behind her league after league.\nToward midday, she slowed her pace to eat treasure-berries along the way; but\neven then she made good speed, and as evening neared she pushed their pace into\na lope again.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Then the untracked path which the\nWoodhelvennin had taught her brought them to the end of a broad valley. After a\nbrief halt while she verified her bearings, she started straight up a long,\nslow hillside that seemed to carry on away eastward for a great distance. She\nchose a plumb-line direction which took her directly between two matched Gilden\ntrees a hundred yards above the valley, and Covenant followed her toiling lope\nup the hill without question. He was too tired and out of breath to ask\nquestions.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>So they ascended that\nhillside-Atiaran trotting upward with her head held high and her hair\nfluttering, .</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>as if she saw fixed before her the\nstarry gates of heaven, and Covenant plodding, pumping behind her. At their\nbacks, the sun sank in a deep exhalation like the release of a long pent-up\nsigh. And ahead of them the slope seemed to stretch on into the sky.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant was dumbfounded when\nAtiaran reached the crest of the hill, stopped abruptly, grabbed his shoulders,\nand spun him around in a circle, crying joyfully, &quot;We are here! We are in\ntime!&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>He lost his balance and fell to\nthe turf. For a moment he lay panting, with hardly enough energy to stare at\nher. But she was not aware of him. Her eyes were fixed down the eastern slope\nof the hill as she calle in a voice shortbreathed by fatigue and exultation and\nreverence, &quot;Banas Nimoram! Ali, glad heart! Glad heart of Andelain. I have\nlived to this time.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Caught by the witchery of her\nvoice, Covenant levered himself to his feet and followed her gaze as if he\nexpected to behold the soul of Andelain incarnate.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>He could not refrain from groaning\nin the first sag of his disappointment. He could see nothing to account for\nAtiaran's rapture, nothing that was more healthy or precious than the myriad\nvistas of Andelain past which she had rushed unheeding. Below him, the grass\ndipped into a smooth wide bowl set into the hills like a drinking cup for the\nnight sky. With the sun gone, the outlines of the bowl were not clear, but\nstarlight was enough to show that there were no trees, no bushes, no\ninterruptions to the smoothness of the bowl. It looked as regular as if the\nsurface of the grass had been sanded and burnished. On this night, the stars\nseemed especially gay, as if the darkness of the moon challenged them to new\nbrightness. But Covenant felt that such things were not enough to reward his\nbone-deep fatigue.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>However, Atiaran did not ignore\nhis groan. Taking his arm, she said, &quot;Do not judge me yet,&quot; and drew</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>him forward. Under the branches of\nthe last tree on the bowl's lip, she dropped her pack and sat against the\ntrunk, facing down the hill. When Covenant had joined her, she said softly,\n&quot;Control your mad heart, Unbeliever. We are here in time. This is Banas\nNimoram, the dark of the moon on the middle night of spring. Not in my\ngeneration has there been such a night, such a time of rareness and beauty. Do\nnot measure the Land by the standard of yourself. Wait. This is Banas Nimoram,\nthe Celebration of Spring-finest rite of all the treasures of the Earth. If you\ndo not disturb the air with anger, we will see the Dance of the Wraiths of\nAndelain.&quot; As she spoke, her voice echoed with rich harmonics as if she\nwere singing; and Covenant felt the force of what she promised, though he did\nnot understand. It was not a time for questions, and he set himself to wait for\nthe visitation.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Waiting was not difficult. First\nAtiaran passed bread and the last of her springwine to him, and eating and\ndrinking eased some of his weariness. Then, as the night deepened, he found\nthat the air which flowed up to them from the bowl had a lush, restful effect.\nWhen he took it far into his lungs, it seemed to unwind his cares and dreads,\nsetting everything but itself behind him and lifting him into a state of calm\nsuspense. He relaxed in the gentle breeze, settled himself more comfortably\nagainst the tree. Atiaran's shoulder touched his with warmth, as if she had\nforgiven him. The night deepened, and the stars gleamed expectantly, and the\nbreeze sifted the cobwebs and dust from Covenant's heart-and waiting was not\ndifficult.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The first flickering light came\nlike a twist of resolution which brought the whole night into focus. Across the\nwidth of the bowl, he saw a flame like the burn of a candle-tiny in the\ndistance, and yet vivid, swaying yellow and orange as clearly as if he held the\ncandlestick in his hands. He felt strangely sure that the distance was\nmeaningless; if the flame were before him on the grass, it would be no larger\nthan his palm.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>As the Wraith appeared, Atiaran's\nbreath hissed intently between her teeth, and Covenant sat up straighter to\nconcentrate more keenly.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>With a lucid, cycling movement,\nthe flame moved down into the bowl. It was not halfway to the bottom when a\nsecond fire arrived on the northern rim. Then two more Wraiths entered from the\nsouth-and then, too suddenly to be counted, a host of flames began tracing\ntheir private ways into the bowl from all directions. Some passed within ten\nfeet of Atiaran and Covenant on either side, but they seemed unconscious of the\nobservers; they followed their slow cycles as if each were alone in the Hills,\nindependent of every gleam but its own. Yet their lights poured together,\ncasting a dome of gold through which the stars could barely be seen; and at\nmoments particular Wraiths seemed to bow and revolve around each other, as if\nsharing a welcome on their way toward the center.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant watched the great\nmovement that brought thousands of the flames, bobbing at shoulder height, into\nthe bowl, and he hardly dared to breathe. In the excess of his wonder, he felt\nlike an unpermitted spectator beholding some occult enactment which was not\nmeant for human eyes. He clutched his chest as if his chance to see the\nCelebration to its end rode on the utter silence of his respiration, as if he\nfeared that any sound might violate the fiery conclave, scare the Wraiths away.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Then a change came over the\ngathered flames. Up into the sky rose a high, scintillating, wordless song, an\narching melody. From the center of the bowl, the private rotations of the\nWraiths resolved themselves into a radiating, circling Dance. Each Wraith\nseemed finally to have found its place in a large, wheel-like pattern which\nfilled half the bowl, and the wheel began to turn on its center. But there were\nno lights in the center; the wheel turned on a hub of stark blackness which\nrefused the glow of the Wraiths.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>As the song spread through the\nnight, the great circle revolved-each flame dancing a secret, independent\ndance, various in moves and sways-each flame keeping its place in the whole\npattern as it turned. And in the space between the inner hub and the outer rim,\nmore circles rolled, so that the whole wheel was filled</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>with many wheels, all turning. And\nno Wraith kept one position long. The flames flowed continuously through their\nmoving pattern, so that as the wheel turned, the individual Wraiths danced from\nplace to place, now swinging along the outer rim, now gyring through the middle\ncircles, now circling the hub. Every Wraith moved and changed places\nconstantly, but the pattern was never broken-no hiatus of misstep gapped the\nwheel, even for an instant-and every flame seemed both perfectly alone,\nwandering mysteriously after some personal destiny through the Dance, and\nperfectly a part of the whole. While they danced, their light grew stronger,\nuntil the stars were paled out of the sky, and the night was withdrawn, like a\ndistant spectator of the Celebration.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>And the beauty and wonder of the\nDance made of Covenant's suspense a yearning ache.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Then a new change entered the\nfestival. Covenant did not realize it until Atiaran touched his arm; her signal\nsent a thrill of awareness through him, and he saw that the wheel of the\nWraiths was slowly bending. The rest of the wheel retained its shape, and the\nblack core did not move. Gradually, the turning circle became lopsided as the\nouter Wraiths moved closer to the onlookers. Soon the growing bulge pointed\nunmistakably at Covenant.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>In response, he seemed to feel\ntheir song more intensely-a keening, ecstatic lament, a threnody as throbbingly\npassionate as a dirge and as dispassionate as a sublime, impersonal\naffirmation. Their nearing flames filled him with awe and fascination, so that\nhe shrank within himself but could not move. Cycle after cycle, the Wraiths\nreached out toward him, and he clasped his hands over his knees and held\nhimself still, taut-hearted and utterless before the fiery Dancers.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>In moments, the tip of this long\nextension from the circle stood above him, and he could see each flame bowing\nto him as it danced by. Then the rim of the extension dipped, and the pace of\nthe Dance slowed, as though to give each Wraith a chance to linger in his\ncompany. Soon the fires were passing within reach of his hand. Then the long\narm of the Dance flared, as if a decision had run through the Dancers. The\nnearest Wraith moved forward to settle on his wedding band.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>He flinched, expecting the fire to\nburn him, but there was no pain. The flame attached itself to the ring as to a\nwick, and he felt faintly the harmonies of the Celebration song through his\nfinger. As the Wraith held to his ring, it danced and jumped as if it were\nfeeding excitedly there. And slowly its color turned from flaming yellow-orange\nto silver-white.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>When the transformation was\ncomplete, that Wraith flashed away, and the next took its place. A succession\nof fires followed, each dancing on his ring until it became argent; and as his\nanxiety relaxed, the succession grew faster. In a short time, the line of\nglistening white Wraiths had almost reached back to the rest of the Dance. Each\nnew flame presented itself swiftly, as if eager for some apotheosis, some\nculmination of its being, in the white gold of Covenant's ring.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Before long, his emotion became\ntoo strong to let him remain seated. He surged to his feet, holding out his\nring so that the Wraiths could light on it without lowering themselves.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Atiaran stood beside him. He had\neyes only for the transformation which his ring somehow made possible, but she\nlooked away across the Dance.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>What she saw made her dig her\nfingers like claws of despair into his arm. &quot;No! By the Seven! This must\nnot be!&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Her cry snatched at his attention;\nhis gaze jumped across the bowl.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;There! That is the meaning\nof the ill your feet have felt!&quot; What he saw staggered him like a blow to\nthe heart.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Coming over the northeast rim of\nthe bowl into the golden light was an intruding wedge of blackness, as\npitch-dark and un-illuminable as the spawning ground of night. The wedge cut\nits narrow way down toward the Dance, and through the song of the flames, it\ncarried a sound like a host of bloody feet rushing over clean grass.\nDeliberately, agonizingly, it reached inward without breaking its formation. In\nmoments, the tip of the darkness sliced into the Dance and began plunging\ntoward its center.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>In horror, Covenant saw that the\nDance did not halt or pause. At the wedge's first touch, the song of the\nWraiths dropped from the air as if it had been ripped away by sacrilege,\nleaving no sound behind it but a noise like running murder. But the Dance did\nnot stop. The flames went on revolving as if they were unconscious of what was\nhappening to them, helpless. They followed their cycles into the wedge's path\nand vanished as if they had fallen into an abyss. No Wraith emerged from that\ndarkness. Swallowing every light that touched it, the black wedge gouged its\nway into the Celebration.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;They will all die!&quot;\nAtiaran groaned. &quot;They cannot stop-cannot escape. They must dance until\nthe Dance is done. All dead-every Wraith, every bright light of the Land! This\nmust not be. Help them! Covenant, help them!&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>But Covenant did not know how to\nhelp. He was paralyzed. The sight of the black wedge made him feel as nauseated\nas if he were observing across a gulf of numbness his fingers being eaten by a\nmadman nauseated and enraged and impotent, as if he had waited too long to\ndefend himself, and now had no hands with which to fight back. The knife of\nTriock slipped from his numb fingers and disappeared in darkness.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>How-?</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>For an instant, Atiaran dragged\nfuriously at him. &quot;Covenant! Help them!&quot; she shrieked into his face.\nThen she turned and raced down into the valley to meet the wedge.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The Wraiths-!</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Her movement broke the freeze of his\nhorror. Snatching up the staff of Baradakas, he ducked under the flames and\nsped after her, holding himself bent over to stay below the path of the\nWraiths. A madness seemed to hasten his feet; he caught Atiaran before she was\nhalfway to the hub. Thrusting her behind him, he dashed on toward the\npenetrating wedge, spurred by a blind conviction that he had to reach the\ncenter before the blackness did.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Atiaran followed, shouting after\nhim, &quot;Ware and ward! They are ur-viles! Demondim corruption!&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>He scarcely heard her. He was\nfocused on the furious need to gain the center of the Dance. For better speed,\nhe ran more upright, flicking his head aside whenever a Wraith flashed near the\nlevel of his eyes.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>With a last burst, he broke into\nthe empty core of the wheel.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>He halted. Now he was close enough\nto see that the wedge was composed of tall, crowded figures, so blackfleshed\nthat no light could gleam or glisten on their skin. As the helpless Wraiths\nswung into the wedge, the attackers ate them.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The ur-viles drew nearer. The tip\nof their wedge was a single figure, larger than the rest. Covenant could see it\nclearly. It looked like one of the Waynhim grown tall and evil-long torso,\nshort limbs of equal length, pointed ears high on its head, eyeless face almost\nfilled by gaping nostrils. Its slit mouth snapped like a trap whenever a Wraith\ncame near. Mucus trailed from its nostrils back along either side of its head.\nWhen Covenant faced it, its nose twitched as if it smelled new game, and it\nsnarled out a cadenced bark like an exhortation to the other creatures. The\nwhole wedge thrust eagerly forward.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Atiaran caught up with Covenant\nand shouted in his ear, &quot;Your hand! Look at your hand!&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>He jerked up his left hand. A\nWraith still clung to his ring-burning whitely-obliviously dancing.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The next instant, the leading\nur-vile breached the core of the Dance and stopped. The attackers stood packed\nagainst each other's shoulders behind their leader. Dark, roynish, and cruel,\nthey slavered together and bit at the helpless Wraiths.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant quailed as if his heart\nhad turned to sand. But Atiaran raged, &quot;Now! Strike them now!&quot;\nTrembling, he stepped forward. He had no idea what to do.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>At once, the first ur-vile\nbrandished a long knife with a seething, blood-red blade. Fell power radiated\nfrom the blade; in spite of themselves, Covenant and Atiaran recoiled.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The ur-vile raised its hand to\nstrike.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Impulsively, Covenant shoved the\nwhite, burning Wraith at the ur-vile's face. With a snarl of pain, the creature\njumped back.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>A sudden intuition gripped\nCovenant. Instantly, he touched the end of his staff to the burning Wraith.\nWith a flash, bold white flame bloomed from the staff, shading the gold of the\nDance and challenging the force of the ur-viles. Their leader retreated again.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>But at once it regained its\ndetermination. Springing forward, it stabbed into the heart of the white fire\nwith its blood-red blade.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Power clashed in the core of the\nDance. The ur-vile's blade seethed like hot hate, and the staff blazed wildly.\nTheir conflict threw sparks as if the air were aflame in blood and lightning.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>But the ur-vile was a master. Its\nmight filled the bowl with a deep, crumbling sound, like the crushing of a\nboulder under huge pressure. In one abrupt exertion, Covenant's fire was\nstamped out.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The force of the extinguishing\nthrew him and Atiaran to their backs on the grass. With a growl of triumph, the\nur-viles poised to leap for the kill.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant saw the red knife coming,\nand cowered with a pall of death over his mind.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>But Atiaran scrambled back to her\nfeet, crying, &quot;Melenkurion! Melenkurion abatha!&quot; Her voice sounded\nfrail against the victory of the ur-viles, but she met them squarely, grappled\nwith the leader's knife-hand. Momentarily, she withheld its stroke.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Then, from behind her to the west,\nher cry was answered. An iron voice full of fury shouted, &quot;Melenkurion\nabatha! Binas mill Banas Nimoram khabaal! Melenkurion abatha! Abatha\nNimoram!&quot; The sound broke through Covenant's panic, and he lurched up to\nAtiaran's aid. But together they could not hold back the ur-vile; it flung them\nto the ground again. At once, it pounced at them.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>It was stopped halfway by a\nhulking form that leaped over them to tackle it. For a moment, the two wrestled\nsavagely. Then the newcomer took the bloodred blade and drove it into the heart\nof the creature.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>A burst of snarls broke from the\nur-viles. Covenant heard a sweeping noise like the sound of many children\nrunning. Looking up, he saw a stream of small animals pour into the\nbowl-rabbits, badgers, weasels, moles, foxes, a few dogs. With silent\ndetermination, they hurled themselves at the ur-viles.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The Wraiths were scattering. While\nCovenant and Atiaran stumbled to their feet, the last flame passed from the\nbowl.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>But the ur-viles remained, and\ntheir size made the animals' attack look like a mere annoyance. In the sudden\ndarkness, the creatures seemed to expand, as if the light had hindered them,\nforced them to keep their close ranks. Now they broke away from each other.\nDozens of blades that boiled like lava leaped out as one, and in horrible\nunison began to slaughter the animals.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Before Covenant could take in all\nthat was happening, the hulking figure who had saved them turned and hissed,\n&quot;Go! North to the river. I have released the Wraiths. Now we will make\ntime for your escape. Go!&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;No!&quot; Atiaran panted.\n&quot;You are the only man. The animals are not enough. We must help you\nfight.&quot; &quot;Together we are not enough!&quot; he cried. &quot;Do you\nforget your task? You must reach the Lords-must!</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Drool must pay for this\nDesecration! Go! I cannot give you much time!&quot; Shouting, &quot;Melenkurion\nabatha!&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>he whirled and jumped into the\nthick of the fray, felling ur-viles with his mighty fists.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Pausing only to pick up the staff\nof Baradakas, Atiaran fled northward. And Covenant followed her, running as if\nthe ur-vile blades were striking at his back. The stars gave them enough light.\nThey drove themselves up the slope, not looking to see if they were pursued,\nnot caring about the packs they left behind afraid to think of anything except\ntheir need for distance. As they passed over the rim of the bowl, the sounds of\nslaughter were abruptly dimmed. They heard no pursuit. But they ran on-ran, and\nstill ran, and did not stop until they were caught in midstride by a short\nscream, full of agony and failed strength.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>At the sound, Atiaran fell to her\nknees and dropped her forehead to the earth, weeping openly. &quot;He is\ndead!&quot; she wailed. &quot;The Unfettered One, dead! Alas for the Land! All\nmy paths are ill, and destruction fills all my choices. From the first, I have\nbrought wrong upon us. Now there will be no more Celebrations, and the blame is\nmine.&quot; Raising her face to Covenant, she sobbed, &quot;Take your staff and\nstrike me, Unbeliever!&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Blankly, Covenant stared into the\npooled hurt of her eyes. He felt benumbed with pain and grief and wasted rage,\nand did not understand why she castigated herself. He stooped for the staff,\nthen took her arm and lifted her to her feet. Stunned and empty, he led her\nonward into the night until she had cried out her anguish and could stand on\nher own again. He wanted to weep himself, but in his long struggle with the\nmisery of being a leper he had forgotten how, and now he could only keep on\nwalking. He was</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>aware as Atiaran regained control\nof herself and pulled away from him that she accused him of something.\nThroughout the sleepless night of their northward trek, he could do nothing\nabout it.<br clear=all style='page-break-before:always'>\n</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><a name=\"_Toc370739016\"><span class=Heading1Char><span\nstyle='font-size:16.0pt;line-height:105%'>ELEVEN: The Unhomed</span></span></a></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Gradually, night stumbled as if\nstunned and wandering aimlessly into an overcast day-limped through the\nwilderland of transition as though there were no knowing where the waste of\ndarkness ended and the ashes of light began. The low clouds seemed full of\ngrief-tense and uneasy with accumulated woe -and yet affectless, unable to\nrain, as if the air clenched itself too hard for tears. And through the dawn,\nAtiaran and Covenant moved heavily, unevenly, like pieces of a broken lament.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The coming of one day made no\ndifference to them, did not alter the way they fled-terrorless because their\ncapacity for fear was exhausted-into the north. Day and night were nothing but\ndisguises, motley raiment, for the constant shadow on the Land's heart. To that\nheart they could not guess how much damage had been done. They could only judge\nby their own hurt-and so throughout the long, dismal night and day which\nfollowed the defilement of the Celebration, they walked on haunted by what they\nhad witnessed and numb to everything else, as though even hunger and thirst and\nfatigue were extinguished in them.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>That night, their flesh reached\nthe end of its endurance, and they pitched blindly into sleep, no longer able\nto care what pursuit was on their trail. While they slept, the sky found some\nrelease for its tension. Blue lightning flailed the Hills; thunder groaned in\nlong suppressed pain. When the travelers awoke, the sun stood over them, and\ntheir clothes were drenched with the night's rain. But sunshine and morning\ncould not unscar their wounded memories. They clambered like corpses to their\nfeet-ate aliantha, drank from a stream-set off again walking as if they were\nstiff with death.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Yet time and aliantha and\nAndelainian air slowly worked their resuscitations. Slowly, Covenant's weary\nthoughts shifted; the trudging horror of slaughter receded, allowed a more\nfamiliar pain to ache in him. He could hear Atiaran crying, Covenant, help\nthem! and the sound made his blood ran cold with impotence.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The Wraiths, the Wraiths! he\nmoaned dimly, distantly, to himself. They had been so beautiful-and he had been\nso unable to save them.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Yet Atiaran had believed him\ncapable of saving them; she had expected some putting forth of power - Like\nLena and Baradakas and everyone else he met, she saw him as Berek Halfhand\nreborn, the master of wild magic. You have might, the Despiser had said. You\nwill never know what it is. He did not know;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>how could he? What did magic, or\neven dreams, have to do with him?</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>And yet the Wraiths had paid\nhomage to his ring as if they recognized his lost humanity. They had been\nchanged by it.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>After a time, he said without\nmeaning to speak aloud, &quot;I would have saved them if I could.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;You have the power.&quot;\nAtiaran's voice was dull, inert, as if she were no longer capable of grief or\nanger.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;What power?&quot; he asked\npainfully.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Do you wear the white gold\nfor nothing?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;It's just a ring. I wear\nit-I wear it because I'm a leper. I don't know anything about power.&quot; She\ndid not look at him. &quot;I cannot see. You are closed to me.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>At that, he wanted to protest, cry\nout, grab her by the shoulders and shout into her face, Closed? Look -look at\nme! I'm no Berek! No hero. I'm too sick for that. But he lacked the strength.\nAnd he had been too badly hurt-hurt as much by Atiaran's impossible demand as\nby his powerlessness.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>How-?</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The Wraiths!</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>How can this happen to me?</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>A moment passed while he groaned\nover the question. Then he sighed to himself, I should have known - He should\nhave heard his danger in Atiaran's singing of the Berek legend, seen it in\nAndelain, felt it in the revulsion in his boots. But he had been deaf, blind,\nnumb. He had been so busy moving ahead, putting madness behind him, that he had\nignored the madness toward which the path of his dream tended. This dream\nwanted him to be a hero, a savior; therefore it seduced him, swept him\nalong-urging him forward so that he would run heedless of himself to risk his\nlife for the sake of Wraiths, the Land, illusion. The only difference in this\nbetween Atiaran and Lord Foul was that the Despiser wanted him to fail.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>You will never know what it is. Of\ncourse he would never know. A visceral anger writhed under his fatigue. He was\ndreaming-that was the answer to everything, to the Land's impossible\nexpectations of him as well as to the Land's impossibility. He knew the\ndifference between reality and dream; he was sane.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>He was a leper.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>And yet the Wraiths had been so\nbeautiful. They had been slaughtered I'm a leper!</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Trembling, he began to give\nhimself a VSE. Hellfire! What do Wraiths and wild magic and Berek bloody\nHalfhand have to do with me? His body appeared whole-he could see no injuries,\nhis clothing was rumpled but unrent-but the end of the Hirebrand's staff had\nbeen blackened by the power of the ur-viles. By hell! They can't do this to me.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Fuming against his weariness, he\nshambled along at Atiaran's side. She did not look at him, did not seem to\nrecognize his presence at all; and during that day he left her alone as if he\nfeared how he would respond if he gave her an opportunity to accuse him. But\nwhen they halted that evening, the cold night and the brittle stars made him\nregret the loss of their blankets and graveling. To distract himself from his\nhollow discomfort, he resumed his half-forgotten efforts to learn about the\nLand. Stiffly, he said, &quot;Tell me about that -whoever saved us. Back\nthere.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>A long silence passed before she\nsaid, &quot;Tomorrow.&quot; Her voice was lightless, unillumined by anything</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>expect torpor or defeat. &quot;Let\nme be. Until tomorrow.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant nodded in the darkness.\nIt felt thick with cold and beating wings, but he could answer it better than\nhe could reply to Atiaran's tone. For a long time he shivered as if he were\nprepared to resent every dream that afflicted a miserable mankind, and at last\nhe fell into fitful slumber.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The next day, the ninth from\nSoaring Woodhelven, Atiaran told Covenant about the Unfettered One in a voice\nas flat as crushed rock, as if she had reached the point where what she said,\nhow she exposed herself, no longer mattered to her. &quot;There are those from\nthe Loresraat,&quot; she said, &quot;who find that they cannot work for the\nLand or the Lore of the Old Lords in the company of their fellows-Lords or Lorewardens,\nthe followers of Sword or Staff. Those have some private vision which compels\nthem to seek it in isolation. But their need for aloneness does not divide them\nfrom the people. They are given the Rites of Unfettering, and freed from all\ncommon demands, to quest after their own lore with the blessing of the Lords\nand the respect of all who love the Land. For the Lords learned long ago that\nthe desire for aloneness need not be a selfish desire, if it is not made so by\nthose who do not feel it.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Many of the Unfettered have\nnever returned into knowledge. But stories have grown up around those Ones who\nhave not vanished utterly. Some are said to know the secrets of dreams, others\nto practice deep mysteries in the arts of healing, still others to be the friends\nof the animals, speaking their language and calling on their help in times of\ngreat need.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Such a One saved\nus&quot;-her voice thickened momentarily-&quot;a learner of the Wraiths and a\nfriend to the small beasts of the woods. He knew more of the Seven Words than\nmy ears have ever heard.&quot; She groaned softly. &quot;A mighty man, to have\nbeen so slain. He released the Wraiths, and saved our lives. Would that I were\nworth so much. By the Seven! No evil has ever before been aimed at the Wraiths\nof Andelain. The Gray Slayer himself never dared- And it is said that the\nRitual of Desecration itself had no power to touch them. Now it is in my heart\nthat they will not dance again.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>After a heavy pause, she went on:\n&quot;No matter. All things end, in perversion and death. Sorrow belongs to\nthose who also hope. But that Unfettered One gave his life so that you and your\nmessage and your ring might reach the Lords. This we will accomplish, so that\nsuch sacrifices may have meaning.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>She fell silent again for a\nmoment, and Covenant asked himself, Is that why? Is that what living is for? To\nvindicate the deaths of others? But he said nothing, and shortly Atiaran's\nthoughts limped back to her subject. &quot;But the Unfettered. Some are\ndreamers, some healers, some share the life of the animals. Some delve the\nearth to uncover the secrets of the Cavewights, others learn the lore of the\nDemondim whatever knowledge guides the One's private prophecy. I have even\nheard it whispered that some Unfettered follow the legend of Caerroil Wildwood\nof Garroting Deep, and become Forestals. But that is a perilous thought, even\nwhen whispered.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Never before have I seen one\nof the Unfettered. But I have heard the Rites of Unfettering. A hymn is\nsung.&quot; Dully, she recited:</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Free Unfettered Shriven</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Free- Dream that what is dreamed\nwill be: Hold eyes clasped shut until they see, And sing the silent prophecy\nAnd be Unfettered Shriven Free.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>There is more, but my weakness\nwill not recall- It may be that I will not sing any song again.&quot; She\npulled her robe tight around her shoulders as if a wind were chilling through\nher, and said nothing more for the rest of the day.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>That night, when they had camped,\nCovenant again could not sleep. Unwillingly he lay awake and watched for the\nsliver of the new moon. When it finally rose over the Hills, he was appalled to\nsee that it was no longer silver-white, but red-the color of blood and Drool's\nlaval eyes.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>It hued the Hills with wrongness,\ngave the night a tinge of crimson like blood sweat sheening the shrubs and\ntrees and grass and slopes, as if the whole of Andelain were in torment. Under\nit, the violated ground shimmered as if it were shuddering.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant stared at it, could not\nclose his eyes. Though he badly wanted company, he clamped his teeth together,\nrefused to awaken Atiaran. Alone and shivering, with the staff of Baradakas\nclutched in his sweating hands, he sat up until moonset, then slept on the edge\nof consternation until dawn.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>And on the fourth day after the\nnight of the Dance, it was he who set the pace of their traveling. He pushed\ntheir speed more and more as the day passed, as though he feared that the\nbloody moon were gaining on them.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>When they halted for the night, he\ngave Atiaran his staff and made her sit awake to see the moon. It came over the\nhorizon in a crimson haze, rising like a sickle of blood in the heavens. Its\ncrescent was noticeably fuller than it had been the previous night. She stared\nat it rigidly, clenched the staff, but did not cry out. When she had tasted all\nits wrong, she said tonelessly, &quot;There is no time,&quot; and turned her\nface away.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>But when morning came, she once\nmore took charge of their pace. Under the pall of the despoiled moon she seemed\nto- have reached a resolution, and now she drove herself forward as if she were\nspurred by some self curse or flagellation which rejected through naked\ndetermination the logic of defeat. She seemed to believe that she had lost\neverything for herself and for the Land, yet the way she walked showed that\npain could be as sharp a goad as any. Again Covenant found himself hurrying as\nhard as he could to keep up with her fierce back.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>He accepted her pace in the name\nof his complex dread; he did not want to be caught by the forces that could\nattack Wraiths and render moons incarnadine. But he was scrupulous about his VSE\nand other self protections. If he could have found a blade other than his\npenknife, he would have shaved with it.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>They spent that day, part of the\nnight, and the morning of the next day stumbling forward on the verge of a run.\nCovenant sustained their rate as best he could, but long days and restless\nnights had drained his stamina, made his stride ragged and his muscles\nirresilient. He came to lean more and more on his staff, unable to keep his\nbalance without it. And even with it he might have fallen if he had been\npursuing such a pace in some other region. But the keen essence of Andelain\nsupported him. Healthy air salved his lungs, thick grass cushioned his sore\njoints, Gilden shaded him, treasure-berries burst with energy in his mouth.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>And at last, near noon on the\nsixth day, he and Atiaran staggered over the crest of a hill and saw at the\nbottom of the slope beyond them the Soulsease River.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Blue under the azure sky, it\nmeandered broad, quiet and slow almost directly eastward across their path like\na demarcation or boundary of achievement. As it turned and ran among the Hills,\nit had a glitter of youth, a sparkle of contained exuberance which could burst\ninto laughter the moment it was tickled by any shoals. And its water was as\nclean, clear and fresh as an offer of baptism. At the sight of it, Covenant\nfelt a rushing desire to plunge in, as if the stream had the power to wash away\nhis mortality.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>But he was distracted from it\nalmost immediately.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Some distance away to the west,\nand moving upstream in the center of the river, was a boat like a skiff with a\ntall figure in the stern. The instant she saw it, Atiaran cried out sharply,\nwaved her arms, then</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>began pelting down the slope,\ncalling with a frantic edge to her voice, &quot;Hail! Help! Come back! Come\nback!&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant followed less urgently.\nHis gaze was fixed on the boat. With a swing of its prow, it turned in their\ndirection.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Atiaran threw her arms into the\nair again, gave one more call, then dropped to the ground. When Covenant\nreached her, she was sitting with her knees clasped to her chest, and her lips\ntrembled as if her face were about to break. She stared feverishly at the\napproaching boat.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>As it drew nearer, Covenant began\nto see with growing surprise just how tall the steering figure was. Before the boat\nwas within a hundred feet of them, he was sure that the steersman was twice his\nown height. And he could see no means of propulsion. The craft appeared to be\nnothing more than an enormous rowboat, but there were no oarlocks, no oars, no\npoles. He gaped widely at the boat as it glided closer.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>When it was within thirty feet of\nthem, Atiaran thrust herself to her feet and called out, &quot;Hail,\nRockbrother! The Giants of Seareach are another name for friendship! Help\nus!&quot; The boat kept gliding toward the bank, but its steersman did not\nspeak; and shortly Atiaran added in a whisper that only Covenant could hear,\n&quot;I beg you.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The Giant kept his silence as he\napproached. For the last distance, he swung the tiller over so that the boat's\nprow aimed squarely at the riverbank. Then, just before the craft struck, he\ndrove his weight down in the stern. The prow lifted out of the water and\ngrounded itself securely a few yards from Atiaran and Covenant. In a moment,\nthe Giant stood before them on the grass, offering them the salute of welcome.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant shook his head in wonder.\nHe felt that it was impossible for anyone to be so big; the Giant</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>was at least twelve feet tall. But\nthe rocky concreteness of the Giant's presence contradicted him. The Giant\nstruck his perceptions as tangibly as stumbling on rough stone.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Even for a being twelve feet tall,\nhe appeared gnarled with muscles, like an oak come to life. He was dressed in a\nheavy leather jerkin and leggings, and carried no weapons. A short beard, as\nstiff as iron, jutted from his face. And his eyes were small, deep-set and\nenthusiastic. From under his brows, massed over his sockets like the wall of a\nfortress, his glances flashed piercingly, like gleams from his cavernous\nthoughts. Yet, in spite of his imposing appearance, he gave an impression of\nincongruous geniality, of inunense good humor.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Hail, Rocksister,&quot; he\nsaid in a soft, bubbling tenor voice which sounded too light and gentle to come\nfrom his bemuscled throat. &quot;What is your need? My help is willing, but I\nam a legate, and my embassy brooks little delay.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant expected Atiaran to blurt\nout her plea; the hesitation with which she met the Giant's offer disturbed\nhim. For a long moment, she gnawed her lips as if she were chewing over her\nrebellious flesh, searching for an utterance which would give direction, one\nway or another, to a choice she hated. Then, with her eyes downcast as if in\nshame, she murmured uncertainly, &quot;Where do you go?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>At her question, the Giant's eyes\nflashed, and his voice bubbled like a spring of water from a rock as he said,\n&quot;My destination? Who is wise enough to know his own goal? But I am bound\nfor- No, that name is too long a story for such a time as this. I go to Lord's\nKeep, as you humans call it.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Still hesitating, Atiaran asked,\n&quot;What is your name?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;That is another long\nstory,&quot; the Giant returned, and repeated, &quot;What is your need?&quot;\nBut Atiaran insisted dully, &quot;Your name.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Again a gleam sprang from under\nthe Giant's massive brows. &quot;There is power in names. I do not wish to be\ninvoked by any but friends.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Your name!&quot; Atiaran\ngroaned.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>For an instant, the Giant paused,\nindecisive.. Then he said, &quot;Very well. Though my embassy is not a light\none, I will answer for the sake of the loyalty between my people and yours. To\nspeak shortly, I am called Saltheart Foamfollower.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Abruptly, some resistance, some\nhatred of her decision, crumbled in Atiaran as if it had been defeated at last\nby the Giant's trust. She raised her head, showing Covenant and Foamfollower\nthe crushed landscape behind her eyes. With grave deliberation, she gave the\nsalute of welcome. &quot;Let it be so. Saltheart Foamfollower, Rockbrother and\nGiants' legate, I charge you by the power of your name, and by the great Keep\nof faith which was made between Damelon Giantfriend and your people, to take\nthis man, Thomas Covenant, Unbeliever and stranger to the Land, in safety to\nthe Council of Lords. He bears messages to the Council from Kevin's Watch. Ward\nhim well, Rockbrother. I can go no farther.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>What? Covenant gaped. In his\nsurprise, he almost protested aloud, And give up your revenge? But he held\nhimself still with his thoughts reeling, and waited for her to take a stance he\ncould comprehend.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Ah, you are too quick to\ncall on such bold names,&quot; the Giant said softly. &quot;I would have accepted\nyour charge without them. But I urge you to join us. There are rare healings at\nLord's Keep. Will you not</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>come? Those who await you would\nnot begrudge such a sojourn-not if they could see you as I do now.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Bitterness twisted Atiaran's lips.\n&quot;Have you seen the new moon? That comes of the last healing I looked\nfor.&quot; As she went on, her voice grew gray with self-despite. &quot;It is a\nfutile charge I give you. I have already caused it to fail. There has been\nmurder in all my choices since I became this man's guide, such murder-&quot;\nShe choked on the bile of what she had seen, and had to swallow violently\nbefore she could continue. &quot;Because my path took us too close to Mount\nThunder. You passed around that place. You must have seen the evil working\nthere.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Distantly, the Giant said, &quot;I\nsaw.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;We went into the knowledge\nof that wrong, rather than make our way across the Center Plains. And now it is\ntoo late for anyone. He- The Gray Slayer has returned. I chose that path\nbecause I desired healing for myself. What will happen to the Lords if I ask\nthem to help me now?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>And give up your revenge? Covenant\nwondered. He could not comprehend. He turned completely to. ward her and\nstudied her face, trying to see her health, her spirit.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>She looked as if she were in the\ngrip of a ravaging illness. Her mien had thinned and sharpened; her spacious\neyes were shadowed, veiled in darkness; her lips were drained of blood. And\nvertically down the center of her forehead lay a deep line like a rift in her\nskull-the tool work of unblinkable despair. Etched there was the vastness of\nthe personal hurt which she contained by sheer force of will, and the damage\nshe did herself by containing it.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>At last Covenant saw clearly the\nmoral struggle that wasted her, the triple conflict between her abhorrence of\nhim, her fear for the Land, and her dismay at her own weakness-a struggle whose\nexpense exhausted her resources, reduced her to penury. The sight shamed his\nheart, made him drop his gaze. Without thinking, he reached toward her and said\n- in a voice full of self-contradicting pleas, &quot;Don't give up.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Give up?&quot; shegasped in\nvirulence, backing away from him. &quot;If I gave up, I would stab you where\nyou stand!&quot; Suddenly, she thrust a hand into her robe and snatched out a\nstone knife like the one Covenant had lost. Brandishing it, she spat,\n&quot;Since the Celebration since you permitted Wraiths to die-this blade has\ncried out for your blood: Other crimes I could set aside. I speak for my own.\nBut that- To countenance such desecration-!&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>She hurled the knife savagely to\nthe ground, so that it stuck hilt-deep in the turf by Covenant's feet.\n&quot;Behold!&quot; she cried, and in that instant her voice became abruptly\ngelid, calm. &quot;I wound the Earth instead of you. It is fitting. I have done\nlittle else since you entered the Land.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Now hear my last word,\nUnbeliever. I let you go because these decisions surpass me. Delivering\nchildren in the Stonedown does not fit me for such choices. But I will not\nintrude my desires on the one hope of the Land barren as that hope is. Remember\nthat I have withheld my hand-I have kept my Oath.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Have you?&quot; he asked,\nmoved by a complex impulse of sympathy and nameless ire.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>She pointed a trembling finger at\nher knife. &quot;I have not harmed you. I have brought you here.&quot;\n&quot;You've hurt yourself.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;That is my Oath,&quot; she\nbreathed stiffly. &quot;Now, farewell. When you have returned in safety to your\nown world, remember what evil is.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>He wanted to protest, argue, but\nher emotion mastered him, and he held himself silent before the force of her\nresolve. Under the duress of her eyes, he bent, and drew her knife out of the\ngrass. It came up easily. He half expected to see blood ooze from the slash it\nhad made in the turf, but the thick grass closed over the cut, hiding it as\ncompletely as an absolution. Unconsciously, he tested the blade with his thumb,\nfelt its acuteness.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>When he looked up again, he saw\nthat Atiaran was climbing up the hill and away, moving with the unequal stride\nof a cripple.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>This isn't right! he shouted at\nher back. Have mercy! -pity! But his tongue felt too thick with the pain of her\nrenunciation; he could not speak. At least forgive yourself. The tightness of\nhis face gave him a nasty impression that he was grinning. Atiaran! he groaned.\nWhy are we so unable?</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Into his aching, the Giant's voice\ncame gently. &quot;Shall we go?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Dumbly, Covenant nodded. He tore\nhis eyes from Atiaran's toiling back, and shoved her knife under his belt.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Saltheart Foamfollower motioned\nfor him to climb into the boat. When Covenant had vaulted over the gunwale and\ntaken a seat on a thwart in the prow the only seat in the thirty-foot craft\nsmall enough for him-the Giant stepped aboard, pushing off from the bank at the\nsame time. Then he went to the broad, shallow stern. Standing there, he grasped\nthe tiller. A surge of power flowed through the keel. He swung his craft away\nfrom the riverbank into midstream, and shortly it was moving westward among the\nHills.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>As soon as he had -taken his seat,\nCovenant had turned with failure in his throat to watch Atiaran's progress up\nthe hillside. But the surge of power which moved the boat gave it a brisk pace\nas fast as running, and in moments distance had reduced her to a brown mite in\nthe lush, oblivious green of Andelain. With a harsh effort, he forced his eyes\nto let her go, compelled himself to look instead for the source of the boat's\npower.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>But he could locate no power\nsource. The boat ran smoothly up against the current as if it were being towed\nby fish. It had no propulsion that he could discern. Yet his nerves were\nsensitive to the energy flowing through the keel. Dimly, he asked, &quot;What\nmakes this thing move? I don't see any engine.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Foamfollower stood in the stern,\nfacing upstream, with the high tiller under his left arm and his right held up\nto the river breezes; and he was chanting something, some plainsong ,in a\nlanguage Covenant could not understand-a song with a wave-breaking, salty\ntimbre like the taste of the sea. For a moment after Covenant's question, he\nkept up his rolling chant. But soon its language changed, and Covenant heard\nhim sing:</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Stone and Sea are deep in life,\ntwo unalterable symbols of the world:</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>permanence at rest, and permanence\nin motion;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>participants in the Power that\nremains.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Then Foamfollower stopped, and\nlooked down at Covenant with humor sparkling under his unbreachable brows.\n&quot;A stranger to the Land,&quot; he said. &quot;Did that woman teach you\nnothing?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant stiffened in his seat.\nThe Giant's tone seemed to demean Atiaran, denigrate the cost she had borne;\nhis bland, impregnable forehead and humorous glance appeared impervious to\nsympathy. But her pain was vivid to Covenant. She had been dispossessed of so\nmuch normal human love and warmth. In a voice rigid with anger, he retorted,\n&quot;She is Atiaran Trell-mate, of Mithil Stonedown, and she did better than\nteach me. She brought me safely past Ravers, murdered Waynhim, a bloody moon,\nur-viles, Could you have done it?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Foamfollower did not reply, but a\ngrin spread gaily over his face, raising the end of his beard like a mock\nsalute.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;By hell!&quot; Covenant\nflared. &quot;Do you think I'm lying? I wouldn't condescend to lie to\nyou.&quot; At that, the Giant's humor burst into high, head back, bubbling\nlaughter.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant watched, stifling with\nrage, while Foamfollower laughed. Briefly, he bore the affront. Then he jumped\nfrom his seat and raised his staff to strike the Giant.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Foamfollower stopped him with a\nplacating gesture. &quot;Softly, Unbeliever,&quot; he said. &quot;Will you feel\ntaller if I sit down?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Hell and blood!&quot;\nCovenant howled. Swinging his arms savagely, he struck the floorboards with the\nur-vile--blackened end of his staff.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The boat pitched as if his blow\nhad sent the river into convulsions. Staggering, he clutched a thwart to save\nhimself from being thrown overboard. In a moment, the spasm passed, leaving the\nsun-glittered stream as calm as before. But he remained gripping the thwart for\nseveral long heartbeats, while his nerves jangled and his ring throbbed\nheavily.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant, he snarled to steady\nhimself, you would be ridiculous if you weren't so-ridiculous. He drew himself\nerect, and stood with his feet braced until he had a stranglehold on his\nemotions. Then he bent his gaze toward Foamfollower, probed the Giant's aura.\nBut he could perceive no ill; Foamfollower seemed as hale as native granite.\nRidiculous! Covenant repeated. &quot;She deserves respect.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Ah, forgive me,&quot; said\nthe Giant. With a twist, he lowered the tiller so that he could hold it under\nhis arm in a sitting position. &quot;I meant no disrespect. Your loyalty\nrelieves me. And I know how to value what she has achieved.&quot; He seated\nhimself in the stern and leaned back against the tiller so that his eyes were\nonly a foot above Covenant's. &quot;Yes, and how to grieve for her as well.\nThere are none in the Land, not men or Giants or Ranyhyn, who would bear you\nto-to Lord's Keep faster than I will.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Then his smile returned. &quot;But\nyou, Thomas Covenant, Unbeliever and stranger in the Land-you burn yourself too\nfreely. I laughed when I saw you because you seemed like a rooster threatening\none of the Ranyhyn. You waste yourself, Thomas Covenant.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant took a double grip on his\nanger, and said quietly, &quot;Is that a fact? You judge too quickly,\nGiant.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Another fountain of laughter\nbubbled out of Foamfollower's chest. &quot;Bravely said! Here is a new thing in\nthe Land-a man accusing a Giant of haste. Well, you are right. But did you not\nknow that men consider us a&quot;-he laughed again-&quot;a deliberate people? I\nwas chosen as legate because short human names, which bereave their bearers of\nso much history and power and meaning, are easier for me than for most of my\npeople. But now it appears that they are too easy.&quot; Once more he threw\nback his head and let out a stream of deep gaiety.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant glared at the Giant as if\nall this humor were incomprehensible to him. Then with an effort he pulled\nhimself away, dropped his staff into the bottom of the boat, and sat down on\nthe thwart facing forward, into the west and the afternoon sun. Foamfollower's\nlaughter had a contagious sound, a coloration of uncomplicated joy, but he\nresisted it. He could not afford to be the victim of any more seductions.\nAlready he had lost more of himself than he could hope to regain.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Nerves don't regenerate. He tolled\nthe words as if they were a private litany, icons of his embattled self. Giants\ndon't exist. I know the difference.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Keep moving, survive.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>He chewed his lips as if that pain\ncould help him keep his balance, keep his rage under command.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>At his back, Saltheart\nFoamfollower softly began to chant again. His song rolled through its channel\nlike a long inlet to the sea, rising and falling like a condensation of the\ntides, and the winds of distance blew through the archaic words. At intervals,\nthey returned to their refrain Stone and Sea are deep in life then voyaged away\nagain. The sound of long sojourning reminded Covenant of his fatigue, and he\nslumped in the prow to rest.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Foamfollower's question caught him\nwandering. &quot;Are you a storyteller, Thomas Covenant?&quot; Absently, he\nreplied, &quot;I was, once.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;And you gave it up? Ah, that\nis as sad a tale in three words as any you might have told me. But a life\nwithout a tale is like a sea without salt. How do you live?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant folded his arms across\nthe gunwales and rested his chin on them. As the boat moved,</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Andelain opened constantly in\nfront of him like a bud; but he ignored it, concentrated instead on the plaint\nof water past the prow. Unconsciously, he clenched his fist over his ring.\n&quot;I live.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Another?&quot; Foamfollower\nreturned. &quot;In two words, a story sadder than the first. Say no more-with\none word you will make me weep.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>If the Giant intended any umbrage,\nCovenant could not hear it. Foamfollower sounded half teasing, half\nsympathetic. Covenant shrugged his shoulders, and remained silent.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>In a moment, the Giant went on:\n&quot;Well, this is a bad pass for me. Our journeying. will not be easy, and had\nhoped that you could lighten the leagues with a story. But no matter. I judge\nthat you will tell no happy tales in any case. Ravers. Waynhim and Andelainian\nWraiths slain. Well, some of this does not surprise me-our old ones have often\nguessed that Soulcrusher would not die as easily as poor Kevin hoped. Stone and\nSeat All that Desecration-ravage and rapine-for a false hope. But we have a\nsaying,</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>and it comforts our children-few\nas they are-when they weep for the nation, the homes, and company of our people,\nwhich we lost-we say, Joy is in the ears that hear, not in the mouth that\nspeaks. The world has few stories glad in themselves, and we must have gay ears\nto defy Despite. Praise the Creator! Old Lord Damelon Giantfriend knew the\nvalue of a good laugh. When we reached the Land, we were too grieved to fight\nfor the right to live.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>A good laugh, Covenant sighed\nmorosely. Did I do a whole life's laughing in that little time?</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;You humans are an impatient\nlot, Thomas Covenant. Do you think that I ramble? Not a bit -I have come\nhastening to the point. Since you have given up the telling of stories, and\nsince it appears that neither of us is happy enough to withstand the recital of\nyour adventures-why, I must do the telling myself. There is strength in stories-heart\nrebirth and thew binding-and even Giants need strength when they face such\ntasks as mine.&quot; He paused, and Covenant, not wishing him to stop -the\nGiant's voice seemed to weave the rush of water past the boat into a soothing\ntapestry-said into the silence, &quot;Tell.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Ali,&quot; Foamfollower\nresponded, &quot;that was not so bad. You recover despite yourself, Thomas\nCovenant. Now, then. Gladden your ears, and listen gaily, for I am no purveyor\nof sorrows-though in times of action we do not wince from facts. If you asked\nme to resail your path here, I would require every detail of you journey before\nI took three steps into the Hills. Resailing is perilous, and too often return\nis impossible the path is lost, or the traveler changed, beyond hope of\nrecovery.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;But you must understand,\nUnbeliever, that selecting a tale is usually a matter for deliberation. The old\nGiantish is a wealth of stories, and some take days in the telling. Once, as a\nchild, I heard three times in succession the tale of Bahgoon the Unbearable and\nThelma Twofist, who tamed him-now that was a story worth the laughter-but nine\ndays were gone before I knew it. However, you do not speak Giantish, and\ntranslation is a long task, even for Giants, so the problem of selection is\nsimplified. But the lore of our life in Seareach since our ships found the Land\ncontains many times many stories-tales of the reigns of Damelon Giantfriend and\nLoric Vilesilencer and Kevin, who is now called Landwaster-tales of the\nbuilding, the carving out of the mountain, of Revelstone, revered rock, `a\nhandmark of allegiance and fealty in the eternal stone of time,' as Kevin once\nsang it, the mightiest making that the Giants have done in the Land, a temple\nfor our people to look upon and remember what can be achieved-tales of the voyage\nwhich saved us from the Desecration, and of the many healings of the new Lords.\nBut again selection is made easy because you are a stranger. I will tell you\nthe first story of the Seareach Giants the Song of the Unhomed.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant looked about him at the\nshining blue tranquility of the Soulsease, and settled himself to hear\nFoamfollower's story. But the narration did not begin right away. Instead of\nstarting his tale, the Giant went back to his antique plainsong, spinning the\nmelody meditatively so that it unrolled like the sea path of the river. For a\nlong time, he sang, and under the spell of his voice Covenant began to drowse.\nHe had too much exhaustion dripping through his bones to keep his attention\nready. While he waited, he rested against the prow like a tired swimmer.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>But then a modulation sharpened\nthe Giant's chant. The melody took on keener edges, and turned itself to the\nangle of a lament. Soon Foamfollower was singing words that Covenant could\nunderstand.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>We are the Unhomed-</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>lost voyagers of the world.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>In the land beyond the Sunbirth\nSea we lived and had our homes and grew- and set our sails to the wind,</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>unheeding of the peril of the\nlost.

Do you\nknow the old lore legend of the Wounded Rainbow, Thomas Covenant? It</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>is said that in the dimmest past\nof the Earth, there were no stars in our sky. The heavens were a blankness\nwhich separated us from the eternal universe of the Creator. There he lived\nwith his people and his myriad bright children, and they moved to the music of\nplay and joy.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Now, as the ages spired from\nforever to forever, the Creator was moved to make a new thing for the happy\nhearts of his children. He descended to the great forges and cauldrons of his\npower, and brewed and hammered and cast rare theurgies. And when he was done,\nhe turned to the heavens, and threw his mystic creation to the sky-and, behold!\nA rainbow spread its arms across the universe.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;For a moment, the Creator\nwas glad. But then he looked closely at the rainbow-and there, high in the\nshimmering span, he saw a wound, a breach in the beauty he had made. He did not\nknow that his Enemy,</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>the demon spirit of murk and mire\nthat crawled through the bowels of even his universe, had seen him at work, and\nhad cast spite into the mortar of his creating. So now, as the rainbow stood\nacross the heavens, it was marred.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;In vexation, the Creator\nreturned to his works, to find a cure for his creation. But while he labored,\nhis children, his myriad bright children, found the rainbow, and were filled\nwith rejoicing at its beauty.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Together, they climbed into the\nheavens and scampered happily up the bow, dancing gay dances across its colors.\nHigh on the span, they discovered the wound. But they did not understand it.\nChorusing joy, they danced through the wound, and found themselves in our sky.\nThis new unlighted world only gladdened them the more, and they spun through\nthe sky until it sparkled with the glee of play.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;When they tired of this\nsport, they sought to return to their universe of light. But their door was\nshut. For the Creator had discovered his Enemy's handiwork--the cause of the\nwound-and in his anger his mind had been clouded. Thoughtless, he had torn the\nrainbow from the heavens. Not until his anger was done did he realize that he\nhad trapped his children in our sky. And there they remain, stars to guide the\nsojourners of our nights, until the Creator can rid his universe of his Enemy,\nand find a way to bring his children Home.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;So it was with us, the\nUnhomed. In our long-lost rocky land, we lived and flourished among our own\nkind, and when we learned to travel the seas we only prospered the more. But in\nthe eagerness of our glee and our health and our wandering, we betrayed\nourselves into folly. We built twenty fine ships, each large enough to be a\ncastle for you humans, and we made a vow among ourselves to set sail and\ndiscover the whole Earth. Ah, the whole Earth! In twenty ships, two thousand\nGiants said high farewells to their kindred, promising to bring back in stories\nevery face of the multitudinous world-and they launched themselves into their\ndream.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Then from sea to sea,\nthrough. tempest and calm, drought and famine and plenty, between reef and\nlandfall, the Giants sailed, glorying in the bite of the salt air, and the\nstretch of sailors' thews, and the perpetual contest with the ocean,\n`permanence in motion'-and in the exaltation of binding together new peoples in\nthe web of their wandering.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Three ships they lost in\nhalf a generation. One hundred Giants chose to remain and live out their lot\nwith the sylvan faery Elohim. Two hundred died in the war service of the\nBhrathair, who were nearly destroyed by the Sand gorgons of the great Desert.\nTwo ships were reefed and wrecked. And when the first children born on the\nvoyage were old enough to be sailors themselves, the fifteen vessels held\ncouncil, and turned their thoughts toward Home-for they had learned the folly\nof their vow, and were worn from wrestling with the seas.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;So they set their sails by\nthe stars, and sought for Home. But they were prevented. Familiar paths led</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>them to unknown oceans and\nunencountered perils. Tempests drove them beyond their reckoning until their\nhands were stripped to the bone by the flailing ropes, and the waves rose up\nagainst them as if in hatred. Five more ships were lost-though the wreckage of\none was found, and the sailors of another were rescued from the island on which\nthey had been cast. Through ice that held them in its clutch for many seasons,\nkilling scores of them-through calms that made them close comrades of\nstarvation-they endured, struggling for their lives and Home. But disasters\nerased every vestige of knowledge from their bearings, until they knew not\nwhere they were or where to go. When they reached the Land, they cast their\nanchors. Less than a thousand Giants stepped down to the rocky shore of\nSeareach. In disconsolation, they gave up their hope of Home.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;But the friendship of High\nLord Damelon Heartthew-son renewed them. He saw omens of promise in his mighty\nLore, and at his word the Giants lifted up their hearts. They made Seareach\ntheir place, and swore fealty to the Lords-and sent three vessels out in quest\nof Home. Since that time-for more than three times a thousand years-there have\nalways been three Giant ships at sea, seeking our land turn by turn, three new\nstanding out when the old return, their hands empty of success. Still we are\nUnhomed, lost in the labyrinth of a foolish dream.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Stone and Sea! We are a\nlong-lived people, compared to your humans -I was born on shipboard during the\nshort voyage which saved us from the Desecration, and my great-grandparents\nwere among the first wanderers. And we have so few children. Rarely does any\nwoman bear more than one child. So now there are only five hundred of us, and\nour vitality narrows with each generation.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;We cannot forget.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;But in the old lore-legend,\nthe children of the Creator had hope. He put rainbows in our sky after cleansing\nrains, as a promise to the stars that somehow, someday, he would find a way to\nbring them home.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;If we are to survive, we\nmust find the Home that we have lost, the heartland beyond the Sunbirth\nSea.&quot; During Foamfollower's tale the sun had declined into late afternoon;\nand as he finished, sunset began on the horizon. Then the Soulsease ran out of\nthe west with fiery, orange-gold glory reflected flame for flame in its\nburnished countenance. In the fathomless heavens the fire radiated both loss\nand prophecy, coming night and promised day, darkness which would pass; for\nwhen the true end of day and light came, there would be no blazonry to make it\nadmirable, no spectacle or fine fire or joy, nothing for the heart to behold\nbut decay and gray ashes.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>In splendor, Foamfollower lifted\nup his voice again, and sang with a plummeting ache:</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>We set our sails to resail our\ntrack;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>but the winds of life blew not the\nway we chose, and the land beyond the Sea was lost.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant pushed himself around to\nlook at the Giant. Foamfollower's head was held high, with wet streaks of\ngleaming gold-orange fire drawn delicately down his cheeks. As Covenant\nwatched, the</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>reflected light took on a reddish\nshade and began to fade.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Softly, the Giant said,\n&quot;Laugh, Thomas Covenant laugh for me. Joy is in the ears that hear.&quot;\nCovenant heard the subdued, undemanding throb and supplication in\nFoamfollower's voice, and his own choked pain groaned in answer. But he could\nnot laugh; he had no laughter of any kind in him. With a spasm of disgust for\nthe limitations that crippled him, he made a rough effort in another direction.\n&quot;I'm hungry.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>For an instant, Foamfollower's\nshadowed eyes flared as if he had been stung. But then he put back his head and\nlaughed for himself. His humor seemed to spring straight from his heart, and\nsoon it had banished all tension and tears from his visage.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>When he had relaxed into quiet\nchuckling, he said, &quot;Thomas Covenant, I do not like to be hasty-but I\nbelieve you are my friend. You have toppled my pride, and that would be fair\nservice even had I not laughed at you earlier.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Hungry? Of course you are\nhungry. Bravely said. I should have offered you food earlier-you have the\ntransparent look of a man who has eaten only aliantha for days. Some old seers\nsay that privation refines the soul-but I say it is soon enough to refine the\nsoul when the body has no other choice.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Happily, I am well supplied\nwith food.&quot; He pushed a prodigious leather sack toward Covenant with his\nfoot, and motioned for him to open it. When Covenant loosened its drawstrings,\nhe found salt beef,</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>cheese, old bread, and more than a\ndozen tangerines as big as his two fists, as well as a leather jug which he\ncould hardly lift. To postpone this difficulty, he tackled the staples first,\nwashing the salt out of his throat with sections of a tangerine. Then he turned\nhis attention to the jug.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;That is diamondraught,&quot;\nsaid Foamfollower. &quot;It is a vital brew. Perhaps I should- No, the more I\nlook at you, my friend, the more weariness I see. Just drink from the jug. It\nwill aid your rest.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Tilting the jug, Covenant sipped\nthe diamondraught. It tasted like light whiskey, and he could smell its\npotency; but it was so smooth that it did not bite or burn. He took several\nrelishing swallows, and at once felt deeply refreshed.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Carefully, he closed the jug,\nreplaced the food in the sack, then with an effort pushed the sack back into\nFoamfollower's reach. The diamondraught glowed in his belly, and he felt that\nin a little while he would be ready for another story. But as he lay down under\nthe thwarts in the bow, the twilight turned into crystal darkness in the sky,\nand the stars came out lornly, like scattered children. Before he knew that he\nwas drowsing, he was asleep.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>It was an uneasy slumber. He\nstaggered numbly through plague-ridden visions full of dying moons and\nslaughter and helpless ravaged flesh, and found himself lying in the street\nnear the front bumper of the police car. A circle of townspeople had gathered\naround him. They had eyes of flint, and their mouths were stretched in one\nuniform rictus of denunciation. Without exception, they were pointing at his\nhands. When he lifted his hands to look at them, he saw that they were rife\nwith purple, leprous bruises.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Then two white-clad, brawny men\ncame up to him and manhandled him into a stretcher. He could see the ambulance\nnearby. But the men did not carry him to it immediately. They stood still,\nholding him at waist level like a display to the crowd.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>A policeman stepped into the\ncircle. His eyes were the color of contempt. He bent over Covenant and</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>said sternly, &quot;You got in my\nway. That was wrong. You ought to be ashamed.&quot; His breath covered Covenant\nwith the smell of attar.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Behind the policeman, someone\nraised his voice. It was as full of unction as that of Joan's lawyer. It said,\n&quot;That was wrong.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>In perfect unison, all the\ntownspeople vomited gouts of blood onto the pavement. I don't believe this,\nCovenant thought.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>At once, the unctuous voice\npurred, &quot;He doesn't believe us.&quot; A silent howl of reality, a rabid\nassertion of fact, sprang up from the crowd. It battered Covenant until he\ncowered under it, abject and answerless.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Then the townspeople chorused,\n&quot;You are dead. Without the community; you can't live. Life is in the\ncommunity, and you have no community. You can't live if no one cares.&quot; The\nunison of their voices made a sound like crumbling, crushing. When they\nstopped, Covenant felt that the air in his lungs had been turned to rubble.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>With a sigh of satisfaction, the\nunctuous voice said, &quot;Take him to the hospital. Heal him. There is only\none good answer to death: Heal him and throw him out.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The two men swung him into the\nambulance. Before the door slammed shut, he saw the townspeople shaking hands\nwith each other, beaming their congratulations. After that, the ambulance\nstarted to move. He raised his hands, and saw that the purple spots were\nspreading up his forearms. He stared at himself in horror, moaning, Hellfire\nhellfire hellfire!</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>But then a bubbling tenor voice\nsaid kindly, &quot;Do not fear. It is a dream.&quot; The reassurance spread\nover him like a blanket. But he could not feel it with his hands, and the\nambulance kept on moving. Needing the blanket, he clenched at the empty air\nuntil his knuckles were white with loneliness.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>When he felt that he could not\nache anymore, the ambulance rolled over, and he fell out of the stretcher into\nblankness.<br clear=all style='page-break-before:always'>\n</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<h1><a name=\"_Toc370739017\">TWELVE: Revelstone</a></h1>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The pressure against his left\ncheek began slowly to wear his skin raw, and the pain nagged him up off the\nbottom of his slumber. Turbulence rushed under his head, as if he were pillowed\non shoals. He labored his way out of sleep. Then his cheek was jolted twice in\nrapid succession, and his resting place heaved. Pushing himself up, he smacked\nhis head on a thwart of the boat. Pain throbbed in his skull. He gripped the\nthwart, swung himself away from the rib which had been rubbing his cheek, and\nsat up to look over the gunwales.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>He found that the situation of the\nboat had changed radically. No shade or line or resonance of Andelainian\nrichness remained in the surrounding terrain. On the northeast, the river was\nedged by a high, bluff rock wall. And to the west spread a gray and barren\nplain, a crippled wilderness like a vast</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>battleground where more than men-\nhad been slain, where the fire that scorched and the blood that drenched had\nblighted the ground's ability to revitalize itself, bloom againan uneven\ndespoiled lowland marked only by the scrub trees clinging to life along the\nriver which poured into the Soulsease a few hundred yards ahead of the boat.\nThe eastering wind carried an old burnt odor, and behind it lay the fetid\nmemory of a crime.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Already, the river joining ahead\ntroubled the Soulsease-knotted its current, stained its clarity with flinty\nmud-and Covenant had to grip the gunwales to keep his balance as the pitching\nof the boat increased.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Foamfollower held the boat in the\ncenter of the river, away from the turmoil against the northeast rock wall.\nCovenant glanced back at the Giant. He was standing in the stern-feet widely\nbraced, tiller clamped under his right arm. At Covenant's glance, he called\nover the mounting clash of the rivers, &quot;Trothgard lies ahead! Here we turn\nnorth-the White River! The Gray comes from the west!&quot; His voice had a\nstrident edge to it, as if he had been singing as strongly as he could all\nnight; but after a moment he sang out a fragment of a different song:</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>For we will not rest- not turn\naside, lost faith, or fail- until the Gray flows Blue, and Rill and Maerl are\nas new and clean as ancient Llurallin.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The heaving of the river mounted\nsteadily. Covenant stood in the bottom of the boat-bracing himself against one\nof the thwarts, gripping the gunwale -and watched the forced commingling of the\nclean and tainted waters. Then Foamfollower shouted, &quot;One hundred leagues\nto the Westron Mountains Guards Gap and the high spring of the Llurallin and\none hundred fifty southwest to the Last Hills and Garroting Deep! We are\nseventy from Lord's Keep!&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Abruptly, the river's moiling\ngrowl sprang louder, smothered the Giant's voice. An unexpected lash of the\ncurrent caught the boat and tore its prow to the right, bringing it broadside\nto the stream. Spray slapped Covenant as the boat heeled over; instinctively,\nhe threw his weight onto the left gunwale.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The neat instant, he heard a\nsnatch of Foamfollower's plainsong, and felt power thrumming deeply along the\nkeel. Slowly, the boat righted itself, swung into the current again.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>But the near-disaster had carried\nthem dangerously close to the northeast wall. The boat trembled with energy as\nFoamfollower worked it gradually back into the steadier water flowing below the\nmain force of the Gray's current. Then the sensation of power faded from the\nkeel.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Your pardon!&quot; the Giant\nshouted. &quot;I am losing my seamanship!&quot; His voice was raw with strain.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant's knuckles were white\nfrom clenching the gunwales. As he bounced with the pitch of the boat, he\nremembered, There is only one good answer to death.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>One good answer, he thought. This\nisn't it.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Perhaps it would be better if the\nboat capsized, tatter if he drowned-better if he did not carry Lord Foul's\nmessage halfhanded and beringed to Revelstone. He was not a hero. He could not\nsatisfy such expectations.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Now the crossing!&quot;\nFoamfollower called. &quot;We must pass the Gray to go on north. There is no\ngreat danger-except that I am weary. And the rivers are high.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>This time, Covenant turned and\nlooked closely at the Giant. He saw now that Saltheart Foamfollower was\nsuffering. His cheeks were sunken, hollowed as if something had gouged the\ngeniality out of his face; and his cavernous eyes burned with taut, febrile\nvolition. Weary? Covenant thought. More like exhausted. He lurched awkwardly\nfrom thwart to thwart until he reached the Giant. His eyes were no higher than\nFoamfollower's waist. He tipped his head back to shout, &quot;I'll steer! You\nrest!&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>A smile flickered on the Giant's\nlips. &quot;I thank you. But no-you are not ready. I am strong enough. But\nplease lift the diamondraught to me.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant opened the food sack and\nput his hands on the leather jug. Its weight and suppleness made it unwieldy\nfor him, and the tossing of the boat unbalanced him. He simply could not lift\nthe jug. But after a moment he got his arms under it. With a groan of exertion,\nhe heaved it upward.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Foamfollower caught the neck of\nthe jug neatly in his left hand. &quot;Thank you, my friend,&quot; he said with\na ragged grin. Raising the jug to his mouth, he disregarded the perils of the\ncurrent for a moment to drink deeply. Then he put down the jug and swung the\nboat toward the mouth of the Gray River.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Another surge of power throbbed\nthrough the craft. As it hit the main force of the Gray, Foamfollower turned\ndownstream and angled across the flow. Energy quivered in the floorboards. In a\nsmooth maneuver, Foamfollower reached the north side of the current, pivoted\nupstream with the backwash along the wall, and let it sling him into the\nuntroubled White. Once he had rounded the northward curve, the roar of the\njoining began to drop swiftly behind the boat.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>A moment later, the throb of power\nfaded again. Sighing heavily, Foamfollower wiped the sweat from his face. His\nshoulders sagged, and his head bowed. With labored slowness, he lowered the\ntiller, and at last dropped into the stern of the boat. &quot;Ah, my\nfriend,&quot; he groaned, &quot;even Giants are not made to do such\nthings.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant moved to the center of\nthe boat and took a seat in the bottom, leaning against one of the sides. From\nthat position, he could not see over the gunwales, but he was not at present\ncurious about the terrain. He had other concerns. One of them was Foamfollower's\ncondition. He did not know how the Giant had become so exhausted.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>He tried to approach the question\nindirectly by saying, &quot;That was neatly done. How did you do it? You didn't\ntell me what powers this thing.&quot; And he frowned at the tactless sound of\nhis voice.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Ask for some other\nstory,&quot; Foamfollower sighed wearily. &quot;That one is nearly as long as\nthe history of</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>the Land. I have no heart to teach\nyou the meaning of life here.&quot; &quot;You don't know any short\nstories,&quot; responded Covenant.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>At this, the Giant managed a wan\nsmile. &quot;Ah, that is true enough. Well, I will make it brief for you. But\nthen you must promise to tell a story for me-something rare, that I will never\nguess for myself. I will need that, my friend.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant agreed with a nod, and\nFoamfollower said, &quot;Well. Eat, and I will talk.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Vaguely surprised at how hungry he\nwas, Covenant tackled the contents of Foamfollower's sack. He munched meat and\ncheese rapidly, satisfied his thirst with tangerines. And while he ate, the\nGiant began in a voice flat with fatigue: &quot;The time of Damelon Giantfriend\ncame to an end in the Land before my people had finished the making of Coercri,\ntheir home in Seareach. They carved Lord's Keep, as men call it, out of the\nmountain's heart before they labored on their own Lord-given land, and Loric\nwas High Lord when Coercri was done. Then my forebearers turned their attention\noutward-to the Sunbirth Sea, and to the friendship of the Land.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Now, both lillianrill and\nrhadhamaerl desired to study the lore of the Giants, and the time of High Lord\nLoric Vilesilencer was one of great growth for the lillianrill. To help in this\ngrowth, it was necessary for the Giants to make many sojourns to Lord's\nKeep&quot; -he broke into a quiet chant, singing for a while as if in\ninvocation of the old grandeur of Giantish reverence-&quot;to mighty\nRevelstone. This was well, for it kept Revelstone bright in their eyes.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;But the Giants are not great\nlovers of walking no more so then than now. So my forebearers bethought them of\nthe rivers which flow from the Westron Mountains to the Sea, and decided to\nbuild boats. Well, boats cannot come here from the Sea, as you may\nknow-Landsdrop, on which stands Gravin Threndor, blocks the way. And no one,\nGiant or otherwise, would willingly sail the Defiles Course from Lifeswallower,\nthe Great Swamp. So the Giants built docks on the Soulsease, upriver from\nGravin Threndor and the narrows now called Treacher's Gorge. There they kept\nsuch boats as this-there, and at Lord's Keep at the foot of Furl Falls, so that\nat least two hundred leagues of the journey might be on the water which we\nlove.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;In this journeying, Loric\nand the lillianrill desired to be of aid to the Giants. Out of their power they\ncrafted Gildenlodea strong wood which they named lor-liarill-and from this wood\nthey made rudders and keels for our riverboats. And it was the promise of the\nOld Lords that, when their omens of hope for us came to pass, then Gildenlode\nwould help us.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Ah, enough,&quot;\nFoamfollower sighed abruptly. &quot;In short, it is I who impel this craft.&quot;\nHe lifted his hand from the tiller, and immediately the boat began to lose\nheadway. &quot;Or rather it is I who call out the power of the Gildenlode.\nThere is life and power in the Earth-in stone and wood and water and earth. But\nlife in them is somewhat hidden-somewhat slumberous. Both knowledge and\nstrength are needed yes, and potent vital songs-to awaken them.&quot; He\ngrasped the tiller again, and the boat moved forward once more.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;So I am weary,&quot; he\nbreathed. &quot;I have not rested since the night before we met.&quot; His tone\nreminded Covenant of Trell's fatigue after the Gravelingas had healed the\nbroken pot. &quot;For two days and two nights I have not allowed the Gildenlode\nto stop or slow, though my bones are weak with the expense.&quot; To the\nsurprise in Covenant's face, he added, &quot;Yes, my friend-you slept for two\nnights and a day. From the west of Andelain across the Center Plains to the\nmarge of Trothgard, more than a hundred leagues.&quot; After a pause, he\nconcluded, &quot;Diamondraught does such things to humans. But you had need of\nrest.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>For a moment, Covenant sat silent,\nstaring at the floorboards as if he were looking for a place to hit them. His\nmouth twisted sourly when he raised his head and said, &quot;So now I'm rested.\nCan I help?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Foamfollower did not reply\nimmediately. Behind the buttress of his forehead, he seemed to weigh his\nvarious uncertainties before he muttered, &quot;Stone and Sea! Of course you\ncan. And yet the very fact of asking shows that you cannot. Some unwillingness\nor ignorance prevents.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant understood. He could hear\ndark wings, see slaughtered Wraiths. Wild magic! he groaned. Heroism! This is\nunsufferable. With a jerk of his head, he knocked transitions aside and asked\nroughly, &quot;Do you want my ring?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Want?&quot; Foamfollower\ncroaked, looking as if he felt he should laugh but did not have the heart for\nit. &quot;Want?&quot; His voice quavered painfully, as if he were confessing to\nsome kind of aberration. &quot;Do not use such a word, my friend. Wanting is\nnatural, and may succeed or fail without wrong. Say covet, rather. To covet is\nto desire something which should not be given. Yes, I covet your un-Earth, wild\nmagic, peace ending white gold:</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>There is wild magic graven in\nevery rock, contained for white gold to unleash or control I admit the desire.\nBut do not tempt me. Power has a way of revenging itself upon its usurpers. I\nwould not accept this ring if you offered it to me.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;But you do know how to use\nit?&quot; Covenant in quired dully, half dazed by his inchoate fear of the\nanswer.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>This time Foamfollower did laugh.\nHis humor was emaciated, a mere wisp of its former self, but it was clean and\ngay. &quot;Ah, bravely said, my friend. So covetousness collapses of its own\nfolly. No, I do not know. If the wild magic may not be called up by the simple\ndecision of use, then I do not understand it a all. Giants do not have such\nlore. We have always acted for ourselves-though we gladly use such tools as\nGildenlode. Well, I am rewarded for unworthy thoughts. Your pardon, Thomas\nCovenant.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant nodded mutely, as if he\nhad been given an unexpected reprieve. He did not want to know how wild magic\nworked; he did not want to believe in it in any way. Simply carrying it around\nwas dangerous. He covered it with his right hand and gazed dumbly, helplessly,\nat the Giant.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>After a moment, Foamfollower's\nfatigue quenched his humor. His eyes dimmed, and his respiration sighed wearily\nbetween his slack lips. He sagged on the tiller as if laughing had cost him\nvital energy. &quot;Now, my friend,&quot; he breathed. &quot;My courage is\nnearly spent. I need your story.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Story? Covenant thought. I don't\nhave any stories. I burned them.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>He had burned them-both his new\nnovel and his best-seller. They had been so complacent, so abjectly blind to\nthe perils of leprosy, which lurked secretive and unpredictable behind every\nphysical or moral existence-and so unaware of their own sightlessness. They\nwere carrion-like himself, like himself-fit only for flames. What story could\nhe tell now?</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>But he had to keep moving, act,\nsurvive. Surely he had known that before he had become the victim of dreams.\nHad he not learned it at the leprosarium, in putrefaction and vomit? Yes, yes!\nSurvive! And yet this dream expected power of him, expected him to put an end\nto slaughter- Images flashed through him like splinters of vertigo, mirror\nshards: Joan, police car, Drool's Laval eyes. He reeled as if he were falling.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>To conceal his sudden distress, he\nmoved away from Foamfollower, went to sit in the prow facing north. &quot;A\nstory,&quot; he said thickly. In fact, he did know one story-one story in all\nits grim and motley disguises. He sorted quickly, vividly, until he found one\nwhich suited the other things he need to articulate. &quot;I'll tell you a\nstory. A true story.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>He gripped the gunwales, fought\ndown his dizziness.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;It's a story about culture\nshock. Do you know what culture shock is?&quot; Foamfollower did not reply.\n&quot;Never mind. I'll tell you about it. Culture shock is what happens when\nyou take a man out of his own world and put him down in a place where the\nassumptions, the the standards of being a person-are so different that he can't\npossibly understand them. He isn't built that way. If he's-facile-he can\npretend to be someone else until he gets back to his own world. Or he can just\ncollapse and let himself be rebuilt however. There's no other way.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;I'll give you an example.\nWhile I was at the leprosarium, the doctors talked about a man-a leper -like\nme. Outcast. He was a classic case. He came from another country-where leprosy\nis a lot more common-he must have picked up the bacillus there as a child, and\nyears later when he had a wife and three kids of his own and was living in\nanother country, he suddenly lost the nerves in his toes and started to go\nblind.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Well, if he had stayed in\nhis own country, he would have been- The disease is common-it would have been recognized\nearly. As soon as it was recognized, he-and his wife-and his kids-and\neverything he owned-and his houseand his animals-and his close relatives-they\nwould have all been declared unclean.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>His property and house and animals\nwould have been burned to the ground. And he and his wife and his kids and his\nclose relatives would have been sent away to live in the most abject poverty in\na village with other people who had the same disease. He would have spent the\nrest of his life there-without treatment-without hope-while hideous deformity\ngnawed his arms and legs and face-until he and his wife and his kids and his\nclose relatives all died of gangrene.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Do you think that's cruel?\nLet me tell you what did happen to the man. As soon as he recognized his disease,\nhe went to his doctor. His doctor sent him to the leprosarium-alone-without his\nfamily-where the spread of the disease was arrested. He was treated, given\nmedicine and training-rehabilitated. Then he was sent home to live a `normal'\nlife with his wife and kids. How nice. There was only one problem. He couldn't\nhandle it.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;To start with, his neighbors\ngave him a hard time. Oh, at first they didn't know he was sick-they weren't\nfamiliar with leprosy, didn't recognize it-but the local newspaper printed a story\non him, so that everyone in town knew he was the leper. They shunned him, hated\nhim because they didn't know what to do about him. Then he began to have\ntrouble keeping up his self-treatments. His home country didn't have medicine\nand leper's therapy-in his bones he believed that such things were magic, that\nonce his disease was arrested he was cured, pardoned-given a stay of something\nworse than execution. But, to and behold! When he stops taking care of himself,\nthe numbness starts to spread again. Then comes the clincher. Suddenly he finds\nthat behind his back-while he wasn't even looking, much less alert he has been\ncut off from his family. They don't share his trouble-far from it. They want to\nget rid of him, go back to living the way they were before.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;So they pack him off to the\nleprosarium again. But after getting on the plane-they didn't have planes in\nhis home country, either-he goes into the bathroom as if he had been\ndisinherited without anyone ever</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>telling him why and slits his\nwrists.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>He gaped wide-eyed at his own\nnarration. He would have been willing, eager, to weep for the man if he had\nbeen able to do so without sacrificing his own defenses. But he could not weep.\nInstead, he swallowed thickly, and let his momentum carry him on again.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;And I'll tell you something\nelse about culture shock. Every world has its own ways of committing suicide,\nand it is a lot easier to kill yourself using methods that you're not\naccustomed to. I could never slit my wrists. I've read too much about it-talked\nabout it too much. It's too vivid. I would throw up. But I could go to that\nman's world and sip belladonna tea without nausea. Because I don't know enough\nabout it. There's something vague about it, something obscure-something not\nquite fatal.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;So that poor man in the\nbathroom sat there for over an hour, just letting his lifeblood run into the\nsink. He didn't try to get help until all of a sudden, finally, he realized\nthat he was going to die just as dead as he had sipped belladonna tea. Then he\ntried to open the door-but he was too weak. And he didn't know how to push the\nbutton to get help. They eventually found him in this grotesque position on the\nfloor with his fingers broken, as if he-as if he had tried to crawl under the\ndoor. He-&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>He could not go on. Grief choked\nhim into silence, and he sat still for a time, while water lamented dimly past\nthe prow. He felt sick, desperate for survival; he could not submit to these\nseductions. Then Foamfollower's voice reached him. Softly, the Giant said,\n&quot;Is this why you abandoned the telling of stories?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant sprang up, whirled in\ninstant rage. &quot;This Land of yours is trying to kill me!&quot; he spat\nfiercely. &quot;It-you're pressuring me into suicide! White gold!\n-Berek!-Wraiths! You're doing things to me that I can't handle. I'm not that\nkind of person-I don't live in that kind of world. All these-seductions! Hell\nand blood! I'm a leper! Don't you understand that?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>For a long moment, Foamfollower\nmet Covenant's dot gaze, and the sympathy in the Giant's eyes stopped his outburst.\nHe stood glaring with his fingers Jawed while Foamfollower regarded him sadly,\nwearily. He could see that the Giant did not understand; leprosy was a word\nthat seemed to have no meaning in the Land. &quot;Come on,&quot; he said with\nan ache. &quot;Laugh about it. Joy is in the ears that hear.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>But then Foamfollower showed that\nhe did understand something. He reached into his jerkin and drew oat a leather\npacket, which he unfolded to produce a large sheet of supple hide.\n&quot;Here,&quot; he said, &quot;you will see much of this before you are done\nwith the Land. It is clingor. The Giants brought it to the Land long ages\nago-but I will spare us both the effort of telling.&quot; He tore a small\nsquare from the comer of the sheet and handed the piece to Covenant. It was\nsticky on both sides, but transferred easily from hand to hand, and left no\nresidue of glue behind. &quot;Trust it. Place your ring upon that piece and\nhide it under your raiment. No one will know that you bear a talisman of wild\nmagic.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant grasped at the idea.\nTugging his ring from his finger, he placed it on the square of clingor. It\nstuck firmly; he could not shake the ring loose, but he could peel the clingor\naway without difficulty. Nodding sharply to himself, he placed his ring on the\nleather, then opened his shirt and pressed the clingor to the center of his\nchest. It held there, gave him no discomfort. Rapidly, as if to seize an\nopportunity before it passed, he rebuttoned his shirt. To his surprise, he\nseemed to feel the weight of the ring on his heart, but he resolved to ignore\nit.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Carefully, Foamfollower refolded\nthe clingor, replaced it within his jerkin. Then he studied Covenant again\nbriefly. Covenant tried to smile in response, express his gratitude, but his\nface seemed only capable of snarls. At last, he turned away, reseated himself\nin the prow to watch the boat's progress and absorb</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>what Foamfollower had done for\nhim.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>After musing for a time, he\nremembered Atiaran's stone knife. It made possible a self-discipline that he\nsorely needed. He leaned over the side of the boat to wet his face, then took\nup the knife and painstakingly shaved his whiskers. The beard was eight days\nold, but the keen, slick blade slid smoothly over his cheeks and down his neck,\nand he did a passable job of shaving without cutting himself. But he was out of\npractice, no longer accustomed to the risk; the prospect of blood made his\nheart tremble. Then he began to see how urgently he needed to return to his\nreal world, needed to recover himself before he altogether lost his ability to\nsurvive as a leper.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Later that day came rain, a light\ndrizzle which spattered the surface of the river, whorling the sky mirror into\nmyriad pieces. The drops brushed his face like spray, seeped slowly into his\nclothes until he was as soaked and uncomfortable as if he had been drenched.\nBut he endured it in a gray, dull reverie, thinking about what he gained and\nlost by hiding his ring.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>At last, the day ended. Darkness\ndripped into the air as if the rain were simply becoming blacker, and in the\ntwilight Covenant and Foamfollower ate their supper glumly. The Giant was\nalmost too weak to feed himself, but with Covenant's help he managed a decent\nmeal, drank a great quantity of diamondraught.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Then they returned to their\nrespective silences. Covenant was glad for the dusk; it spared him the sight of\nFoamfollower's exhaustion. Unwilling to lie down on the damp floorboards, he\nhuddled cold and wet against the side of the boat and tried to relax,\nAslfeteepr. a time, Foamfollower began to chant faintly:</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Stone and Sea are deep in life,\ntwo unalterable symbols of the world: permanence at rest, and permanence in\nmotion; participants in the Power that remains.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>He seemed to gather strength from\nthe song, arid with it he impelled the boat steadily against the current, drove\nnorthward as if there were no fatigue that could make him falter.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Finally, the rain stopped; the\ncloud cover slowly broke open. But Covenant and Foamfollower found no relief in\nthe clear sky. Over the horizon, the red moon stood like a blot, an imputation\nof evil, on the outraged background of the stars. It turned the surrounding\nterrain into a dank bloodscape, full of crimson and evanescent forms like\nuncomprehended murders. And from the light came a putrid emanation, as if the\nLand were illumined by a bane. Then Foamfollower's plainsong sounded\ndishearteningly frail, futile, and the stars themselves seemed to shrink away\nfrom the moon's course.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>But dawn brought a sunlight-washed\nday unriven by any taint or memory of taint. When Covenant raised himself to\nlook around, he saw mountains directly to the north. They spread away westward,</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>where the tallest of them were\nstill snow-crested; but the range ended abruptly at a point in line with the\nWhite River. Already the mountains seemed near at hand.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Ten leagues,&quot; Foamfollower\nwhispered hoarsely. &quot;Half a day against this current.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The Giant's appearance filled\nCovenant with sharp dismay. Dull-eyed and slack-upped, Foamfollower looked like\na corpse of himself. His beard seemed grayer, as if he had aged several years\novernight, and a trail of spittle he was helpless to control ran from the\ncorner of his mouth. The pulse in his temples limped raggedly. But his grip on\nthe tiller was as hard as a gnarled knot of wood, and the boat plowed stiffly\nup the briskening river.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant moved to the stern to try\nto be of help. He wiped the Giant's lips, then held up the jug of diamondraught\nso that Foamfollower could drink. The fragments of a smile cracked the Giant's\nlips, and he breathed, &quot;Stone and Sea. It is no easy thing to be your\nfriend. Tell your next ferryman to take you downstream. Destinations are for\nstronger souls than mine.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Nonsense,&quot; said\nCovenant gruffly. &quot;They're going to make up songs about you for this.\nDon't you think it's worth it?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Foamfollower tried to respond, but\nthe effort made him cough violently, and he had to retreat into himself,\nconcentrate the fading fire of his spirit on the clench of his fist and the\nprogress of the boat.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;That's all right,&quot;\nCovenant said softly. &quot;Everyone who helps me ends up exhausted-one way or\nanother.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>If I were a poet, I would make up\nyour song myself.&quot; Cursing silently at his helplessness, he fed the Giant\nsections of tangerine until there was no fruit left. As he looked at\nFoamfollower, the tall being shriven of everything except the power to endure,\nself-divested, for reasons Covenant could not comprehend, of every quality of\nhumor or even dignity as if they were mere appurtenances, he felt irrationally\nin debt to Foamfollower, as if he had been sold-behind his back and with blithe\nunregard for his consent-into the usury of his only friend. &quot;Everyone who\nhelps me,&quot; he muttered again. He found the prices the people of the Land\nwere willing to pay for him appalling.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Finally he was no longer able to\nstand the sight. He returned to the bow, where he stared at the looming\nmountains with deserted eyes and grumbled, I didn't ask for this.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Do I hate myself so much? he\ndemanded. But his only answer was the rattle of Foamfollower's breathing.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Half the morning passed that way,\nmeasured in butchered hunks out of the impenetrable circumstance of time by the\nrasp of Foamfollower's respiration. Around the boat the terrain stiffened, as\nif preparing itself for a leap into the sky. The hills grew higher and more\nragged, gradually leaving behind the heather and banyan trees of the plains for\na stiffer scrub grass and a few scattered cedars. And ahead the mountains stood\ntaller beyond the hills with every curve of the river. Now Covenant could see\nthat the east end of the range dropped steeply to a plateau like a stair into\nthe mountains-a plateau perhaps two or three thousand feet high that ended in a\nstraight cliff to the foothills. From the plateau came a waterfall, and some\neffect of the light on the rock made the cascade gleam pale blue as it tumbled.\nFurl Falls, Covenant said to himself. In spite of the rattle of Foamfollower's\nbreathing, he felt a stirring in his heart, as if he were drawing near to\nsomething grand.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>But the drawing near lost its\nswiftness steadily. As the White wound between the hills, it narrowed; and as a\nresult, the current grew increasingly stiff. The Giant seemed to have passed\nthe end of his endurance. His respiration sounded stertorous enough to strangle\nhim at any time; he moved the boat hardly faster than a walk. Covenant did not\nsee how they could cover the last leagues.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>He studied the riverbanks for a\nplace to land the boat; he intended somehow to make the Giant take the boat to\nshore. But while he was still looking, he heard a low rumble in the air like\nthe running of horses.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>What the hell-? A vision of\nur-viles flared in his mind. He snatched up his staff from the bottom of the\nboat and clenched it, trying to control the sudden drum of his trepidation.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The next moment, like a breaking\nwave over the crest of a hill upstream and east from the boat, came cantering a\nscore of horses bearing riders. The riders were human, men and women. The\ninstant they saw the boat, one of them shouted, and the group broke into a\ngallop, sweeping down the hill to rein in at the edge of the river.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The riders looked like warriors.\nThey wore high, soft-soled boots over black leggings, black sleeveless shirts\ncovered by breastplates molded of- a yellow metal, and yellow headbands. A\nshort sword hung from each belt, a bow and quiver of arrows from each back.\nScanning them rapidly, Covenant saw the characteristic features of both\nWoodhelvennin and Stonedownor; some were tall and fair, light-eyed and slim,\nand others, square, dark, and muscular.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>As soon as their horses were\nstopped, the riders slapped their right fists in unison to their hearts, then\nextended their arms, palms forward, in the gesture of welcome. A man\ndistinguished by a black diagonal line across his breastplate shouted over the\nwater, &quot;Hail, Rockbrother! Welcome and honor and fealty to you and to your\npeople! I am Quaan, Warhaft of the Third Eoman of the Warward of Lord's\nKeep!&quot; He paused for a reply, and when Covenant said nothing, he went on\nin a more cautious tone, &quot;Lord Mhoram sent us. He saw that important\nmatters were moving on the river today. We are come as escort.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant looked at Foamfollower,\nbut what he saw only convinced him that the Giant was past knowing what\nhappened around him. He slumped in the stern, deaf and blind to everything\nexcept his failing effort to drive the boat. Covenant turned back toward the\nEoman and called out, &quot;Help us! He's dying!&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Quaan stiffened, then sprang into\naction. He snapped an order, and the next instant he and two other riders\nplunged their horses into the river. The two others headed directly for the\nwest bank, but Quaan guided his horse to intercept the boat. The mustang swam\npowerfully, as if such work were part of its training. Quaan soon neared the\nboat. At the last moment, he stood up on his mount's back and vaulted easily\nover the gunwales. On command, his horse started back toward the east bank.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Momentarily, Quaan measured\nCovenant with his eyes, and Covenant saw in his thick black hair, broad\nshoulders, and transparent face that he was a Stonedownor. Then the Warhaft\nmoved toward Foamfollower. He gripped the Giant's shoulders and shook them,\nbarking words which Covenant could not understand.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>At first, Foamfollower did not\nrespond. He sat sightless, transfixed, with his hand clamped like a deathgrip\nonto the tiller. But slowly Quaan's voice seemed to penetrate him. The cords of\nhis neck trembled as he lifted his head, tortuously brought his eyes into focus\non Quaan. Then, with a groan that seemed to spring from the very marrow of his\nbones, he released the tiller and fell over sideways.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The craft immediately lost\nheadway, began drifting back down river. But by this time the two other riders\nwere ready on the west bank. Quaan stepped past Covenant into the bow of the\nboat, and when he was in position, one of the two riders threw the end of a\nlong line to him. He caught it neatly and looped it over the prow. It stuck\nwhere he put it; it was not rope, but clingor. At once, he turned toward the\neast bank. Another line reached him, and he attached it also to the prow. The\nlines pulled taut; the boat stopped drifting. Then Quaan waved his arm, and the\nriders began moving along the banks, pulling the boat upstream.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>As soon as he understood what was\nbeing done, Covenant turned back to Foamfollower. The Giant lay</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>where he had fallen, and his breathing\nwas shallow, irregular. Covenant groped momentarily for some way to help, then\nlifted the leather jug and poured a quantity of diamondraught over\nFoamfollower's head. The liquid ran into his mouth; he sputtered at it,\nswallowed heavily. Then he took a deep, rattling breath, and his eyes slitted\nopen. Covenant held the jug to his lips, and after drinking from it, he\nstretched out flat in the bottom of the boat. At once, he fell into deep sleep.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>In relief, Covenant murmured over\nhim, &quot;Now that's a fine way to end a song-`and then he went to sleep.'\nWhat good is being a hero if you don't stay awake until you get\ncongratulated?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>He felt suddenly tired, as if the\nGiant's exhaustion had drained his own strength, and sighing he sat down on one\nof the thwarts to watch their progress up the river, while Quaan went to the\nstern to take the tiller. For a while, Covenant ignored Quaan's scrutiny. But\nfinally he gathered enough energy to say, &quot;He's Saltheart Foamfollower,\na-a legate from the Seareach Giants. He hasn't rested since he picked me up in\nthe center of Andelain-three days ago.&quot; He saw comprehension of\nFoamfollower's plight spread across Quaan's face. Then he turned his attention\nto the passing terrain.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The towing horses kept up a good\npace against the White's tightening current. Their riders deftly managed the\nvariations of the riverbanks, trading haulers and slackening one rope or the\nother whenever necessary. As they moved north, the soil became rockier, and the\nscrub grass gave way to bracken. Gilden trees spread their broad boughs and\nleaves more and more thickly over the foothills, and the sunlight made the gold\nfoliage glow warmly. Ahead, the plateau now appeared nearly a league wide, and\non its west the mountains stood erect as if they were upright in pride.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>By noon, Covenant could hear the\nroar of the great falls, and he guessed that they were close to Revelstone,\nthough the high foothills now blocked most of his view. The roaring approached\nsteadily.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Soon the boat passed under a wide\nbridge. And a short time later, the riders rounded a last curve, drew the boat\ninto a lake at the foot of Furl Falls.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The lake was round and rough in\nshape, wide, edged along its whole western side by Gilden and pine. It stood at\nthe base of the cliff-more than two thousand feet of sheer precipice-and the\nblue water came thundering down into it from the plateau like the loud\nheart's-blood of the mountains. In the lake, the water was as clean and cool as\nrain-washed ether, and Covenant could see clearly the depths of its bouldered\nbottom.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Knotted jacarandas with delicate\nblue flowers clustered on the wet rocks at the base of the falls, but most of\nthe lake's eastern shore was clear of trees. There stood two large piers and\nseveral smaller loading docks. At one pier rested a boat much like the one\nCovenant rode in, and smaller craft-skiffs and rafts-were tied to the docks.\nUnder Quaan's guidance, the riders pulled the boat up to one of the piers,\nwhere two of the Eoman made it fast. Then the Warhaft gently awakened Foamfollower.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The Giant came out of his sleep\nwith difficulty, but when he pried his eyes open they were calm, unhaggard,\nthough he looked as weak as if his bones were made of sandstone. With help from\nQuaan and Covenant, he climbed into a sitting position. There he rested,\nlooking dazedly about him as if he wondered where his strength had gone.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>After a time, he said thinly to\nQuaan, &quot;Your pardon, r Warhaft. I am-a little tired.&quot; &quot;I see\nyou,&quot; Quaan murmured. &quot;Do not be concerned. Revelstone is near.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>For a moment, Foamfollower frowned\nin perplexity as he tried to remember what had happened to him. Then a look of\nrecollection tensed his face. &quot;Send riders,&quot; he breathed urgently.\n&quot;Gather the Lords. There must be a Council.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Quaan smiled. &quot;Times change,\nRockbrother. The newest Lord, Mhoram son of Variol, is a seer and oracle. Ten\ndays ago he sent riders to the Loresraat, and to High Lord Prothall in the\nnorth. All will be at the Keep tonight.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;That is well,&quot; the\nGiant sighed. &quot;These are shadowed times. Terrible purposes are\nabroad.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;So we have seen,&quot;\nresponded Quaan grimly. &quot;But Saltheart Foamfollower has hastened enough. I\nwill send the fame of your brave journey ahead to the Keep. They will provide a\nlitter to bear you, if you desire it.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Foamfollower shook his head, and\nQuaan vaulted up to the pier to give orders to one of his Eoman.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The Giant looked at Covenant and\nsmiled faintly. &quot;Stone and Sea, my friend,&quot; he said, &quot;did I not\nsay that I would bring you here swiftly?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>That smile touched Covenant's\nheart like a clasp of affection. Thickly, he replied, &quot;Next time take it\neasier. I can't stand-watching- Do you always keep promises-this way?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Your messages are urgent.\nHow could I do otherwise?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>From his leper's perspective,\nCovenant countered, &quot;Nothing's that urgent. What good does anything do you\nif you kill yourself in the process?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>For a moment, Foamfollower did not\nrespond. He braced a heavy hand on Covenant's shoulder, and heaved himself,\ntottering, to his feet. Then he said as if he were answering Covenant's question,\n&quot;Come. We must see Revelstone.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Willing hands helped him onto the\npier, and shortly he was standing on the shore of the lake. Despite the toll of\nhis exertion, he dwarfed even the men and women on horseback. And as Covenant\njoined him, he introduced his passenger with a gesture like an according of\ndominion. &quot;Eoman of the Warward, this is my friend, Thomas Covenant,\nUnbeliever and message-bearer to the Council of Lords. He partakes of many\nstrange knowledges, but he does not know the Land. Ward him well, for the sake\nof friendship, and for the semblance which he bears of Berek Heartthew,\nEarthfriend and Lord-Fatherer.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>In response, Quaan gave, Covenant\nthe salute of welcome. &quot;I offer you the greetings of Lord's Keep,\nGiant-wrought Revelstone,&quot; he said. &quot;Be welcome in the Land-welcome\nand true.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant returned the gesture\nbrusquely, but did not speak, and a moment later Foamfollower said to Quaan,\n&quot;Let us go. My eyes are hungry to behold the great work of my\nforebearers.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The Warhaft nodded, spoke to his\ncommand. At once, two riders galloped away to the east, and two more took\npositions on either side of the Giant so that he could support himself on the\nbacks of their horses. Another warrior, a young, fair-haired Woodhelvennin\nwoman, offered Covenant a ride behind her. For the first time, he noticed that\nthe saddles of the Eoman were nothing but clingor, neither horned nor padded,\nforming broad seats and tapering on either side into stirrup loops. It would be\nlike riding a blanket glued to both horse and rider. But though Joan had taught\nhim the rudiments of riding, he had never overcome his essential distrust of\nhorses. He refused the offer. He got his staff from the boat and</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>took a place beside one of the\nhorses supporting Foamfollower, and the Eoman started away from the lake with\nthe two travelers.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>They passed around one foothill on\nthe south side, and joined the road from the bridge below the lake. Eastward,\nthe road worked almost straight up the side of a traverse ridge. The steepness\nof the climb made Foamfollower stumble several times, and he was barely strong\nenough to catch himself on the horses. But when he had labored up the ridge, he\nstopped, lifted up his head, spread his arms wide, and began to laugh.\n&quot;There, my friend. Does that not answer you?&quot; His voice was weak, but\ngay with refreshed joy.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Ahead over a few lower hills was\nLord's Keep.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The sight caught Covenant by\nsurprise, almost took his breath away. Revelstone was a masterwork. It stood in\ngranite permanence like an enactment of eternity, a timeless achievement formed\nof mere lasting rock by some pure, supreme Giantish participation in skill.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant agreed that Revelstone\nwas too short a same for it.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The eastern end of the plateau was\nfinished by a broad shaft of rock, half as high as the plateau and separate\nfrom it except at the base, the first several hundred feet. This shaft had been\nhollowed into a tower which guarded the sole entrance to the Keep, and circles\nof windows rose up past the abutments to the fortified crown. But most of Lord's\nKeep was carved into the mountain gut-rock under the plateau.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>A surprising distance from the\ntower, the entire cliff face had been worked by the old Giants-sheered and\ncrafted into a vertical outer wall for the city, which, Covenant later learned,\nfilled this whole, wedge shaped promontory of the plateau. The wall was\nintricately labored-lined and coigned and serried with regular and irregular\ngroups of windows, balconies, buttresses-orieled and parapeted-wrought in a\nprolific and seemingly spontaneous multitude of details which appeared to be on\nthe verge of crystallizing into a pattern. But light flashed and danced on the\npolished cliff face, and the wealth of variation in the work overwhelmed\nCovenant's senses, so that he could not grasp whatever pattern might be there.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>But with his new eyes he could see\nthe thick, bustling, communal life of the city. It shone from behind the wall\nas if the rock were almost translucent, almost lit from within like a\nchiaroscuro by the lifeforce of its thousands of inhabitants. The sight made\nthe whole Keep swirl before him. Though he looked at it from a distance, and\ncould encompass it all Furl Falls roaring on one side and the expanse of the\nplains reclining on the other-he felt that the old Giants had outdone him. Here\nwas a work worthy of pilgrimages, ordeals. He was not surprised to hear\nFoamfollower whisper like a vestal, &quot;Ah, Revelstone! Lord's Keep! Here the\nUnhomed surpass their loss.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The Eoman responded in litany:</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Giant-troth Revelstone, ancient\nward- Heart and door of Earthfriend's main: Preserve the true with Power's\nsword, Thou ages-Keeper, mountain-reign!</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Then the riders started forward\nagain. Foamfollower and Covenant moved in wonder toward the looming walls, and\nthe distance passed swiftly, unmarked except by the beat of their uplifted\nhearts.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The road ran parallel to the cliff\nto its eastern edge, then turned up toward the tall doors in the southeast base\nof the tower. The gates-a mighty slab of rock on either side-were open in the\nfree welcome of peace; but they were notched and beveled and balanced so that\nthey could swing shut and interlock, closing like teeth. The entrance they\nguarded was large enough for the whole Eoman to ride in abreast.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>As they approached the gates,\nCovenant saw a blue flag flying high on the crown of the tower-an azure\noriflamme only a shade lighter than the clear sky. Beneath it was a smaller\nflag, a red pennant the color of the bloody moon and Drool's eyes. Seeing the\ndirection of Covenant's gaze, the woman near him said, &quot;Do you know the\ncolors? The blue is High Lord's Furl, the standard of the Lords. It signifies\ntheir Oath and guidance to the peoples of the Land. And the red is the sign of\nour present peril. It will fly there whil the danger lasts.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant nodded without taking his\neyes off the Keep. But after a moment he looked away from the flags down toward\nthe entrance to Revelstone. The opening looked like a cave that plunged\nstraight into the mountain, but he could see sunlight beyond it.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Three sentries stood in an abutment\nover the gates. Their appearance caught Covenant's attention; they did not\nresemble the riders of the Warward. They were like Stonedownors in size and\nbuild, but they were flat-faced and brown-skinned, with curly hair cropped\nshort. They wore short ocher tunics belted in blue that appeared to be made of\nvellum, and their lower legs and feet were bare. Simply standing casual and\nunarmed on the abutment, they bore themselves with an almost feline balance and\nalertness; they seemed ready to do battle at an instant's notice.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>When his Eoman was within call of\nthe gate, Quaan shouted to the sentries; &quot;Hail! First Mark Tuvorl How is\nit that the Bloodguard have become guest welcomers?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The foremost of the sentries\nresponded in a voice that sounded foreign, awkward, as if the speaker were\naccustomed to a language utterly unlike the speech of the Land. &quot;Giants\nand message-bearers have come together to the Keep.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Well, Bloodguard,&quot;\nQuaan returned in a tone of camaraderie, &quot;learn your duties. The Giant is\nSaltheart Foamfollower, legate from Seareach to the Council of Lords. And the\nman, the message-bearer, is Thomas Covenant, Unbeliever and stranger to the\nLand. Are their places ready?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;The orders are given. Bannor\nand Korik await.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Quaan waved in acknowledgment.\nWith his warriors, he rode into the stone throat of Lord's Keep.<br clear=all\nstyle='page-break-before:always'>\n</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><a name=\"_Toc370739018\"><span class=Heading1Char><span\nstyle='font-size:16.0pt;line-height:105%'>THIRTEEN: Vespers</span></span></a></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>As he stepped between the balanced\njaws, Covenant gripped his staff tightly in his left hand. The entrance was\nlike a tunnel leading under the tower to an open courtyard between the tower\nand the main Keep, and it was lit only by the dim, reflected sunlight from\neither end. There were no doors or windows in the stone. The only openings were\ndark shafts directly overhead, which appeared to serve some function in\nRevelstone's defenses. The hooves of the horses struck echoes off the smooth\nstone, filling the tunnel like a rumor of war, and even the light click of\nCovenant's staff pranced about him as if shadows of himself were walking one\nhesitation step behind him down the Keep's throat.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Then the Eoman entered the sunlit\ncourtyard. Here the native stone had been hollowed down to the level of the\nentrance so that a space nearly as wide as the tower stood open to the sky\nbetween high sheer walls.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The court was flat and flagged, but\nin its center was a broad plot of soil out of which grew one old Gilden, and a\nsmall fountain sparkled on either side of the hoary tree. Beyond were more\nstone gates like those in the base of the tower, and they also were open. That\nwas the only ground-level entrance to the Keep, but at intervals above the\ncourt, wooden crosswalks spanned the open space from the tower to crenellated\ncoigns on the inner face of the Keep. In addition, two doors on either side of\nthe tunnel provided access to the tower.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant glanced up the main Keep.\nShadows lay within the south and east walls of the court, but the heights still\ngleamed in the full shine of the afternoon sun, and from his angle, Revelstone\nseemed tall enough to provide a foundation for the heavens. For a moment as he\ngazed, his awe made him wish that he were, like Foamfollower, an inheritor of\nLord's Keep -that he could in some way claim its grandeur for himself. He\nwanted to belong here. But as Revelstone's initial impact on him passed, he\nbegan to resist the desire. It was just another seduction, and he had already\nlost too much of his fragile, necessary independence. He shut down his awe with\na hard frown, pressed his hand against his ring. The fact that it was hidden\nsteadied him.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>There lay the only hope that he\ncould imagine, the only solution to his paradoxical dilemma. As long as he kept\nhis ring secret, he could deliver his message to the Lords, satisfy his exigent\nneed to keep moving, and still avoid dangerous expectations, demands of power\nthat he could not meet.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Foamfollower-and Atiaran, too,\nperhaps involuntarily had given him a certain freedom of choice. Now he might\nbe able to preserve himself-if he could avoid further seductions, and if the\nGiant did not reveal his secret.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Foamfollower,&quot; he began,\nthen stopped. Two men were approaching him and the Giant from the main Keep.\nThey resembled the sentries. Their flat, unreadable faces showed no signs of\nyouth or age, as if their relationship with time was somehow ambivalent; and\nthey conveyed such an impression of solidity to Covenant's eyes that he was\ndistracted from the Giant. They moved evenly across the courtyard as if they\nwere personified rock. One of them greeted Foamfollower, and the other strode\ntoward Covenant.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>When he reached Covenant, he bowed\nfractionally and said, &quot;I am Bannor of the Bloodguard. You are in my\ncharge. I will guide you to the place prepared.&quot; His voice was awkward, as\nif his tongue could not relax in the language of the Land, but through his tone\nCovenant heard a stiffness that sounded like distrust.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>It and the Bloodguard's hard,\nimposing aura made him abruptly uneasy. He looked toward Foamfollower, saw him\ngive the other Bloodguard a salute full of respect and old comradeship.\n&quot;Hail, Korik!&quot; Foamfollower said. &quot;To the Bloodguard I bring\nhonor and fealty from the Giants of Seareach. These are consequential times,\nand in them we are proud to name the Bloodguard among our friends.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Flatly, Korik responded, &quot;We\nare the Bloodguard. Your chambers have been made ready, so that you may rest.\nCome.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Foamfollower smiled. &quot;That is\nwell. My friend, I am very weary.&quot; With Korik, he walked toward the gates.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant started after them, but\nBannor barred his way with one strong arm. &quot;You will accompany me,&quot;\nthe Bloodguard said without inflection.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Foamfollower!&quot; Covenant\ncalled uncertainly. &quot;Foamfollower! Wait for me.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Over his shoulder, the Giant\nreplied, &quot;Go with Bannor. Be at Peace.&quot; He seemed to have no\nawareness of Covenant's misapprehension; his tone expressed only grateful\nrelief, as if rest and Revelstone were his only thoughts. &quot;We will meet\nagain-tomorrow.&quot; Moving as if he trusted the Bloodguard implicitly, he\nwent with Korik into the main Keep.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Your place is in the\ntower,&quot; Bannor said. &quot;In the tower? Why?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The Bloodguard shrugged. &quot;If\nyou question this, you will be answered. But now you must accompany me.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>For a moment, Covenant met\nBannor's level eyes, and read there the Bloodguard's competence, his ability\nand willingness to enforce his commands. The sight sharpened Covenant's anxiety\nstill further. Even the eyes of Soranal and Baradakas when they had first\ncaptured him, thinking him a Raver, had not held such a calm and committed\npromise of coercion, violence. The Woodhelvennin had been harsh because of\ntheir habitual gentleness, but Bannor's gaze gave no hint of any Oath of Peace.\nDaunted, Covenant looked away. When Bannor started toward one of the tower\ndoors, he followed in uncertainty and trepidation.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The door opened as they\napproached, and closed behind them, though Covenant could not see who or what\nmoved it. It gave into an open-centered, spiral stairwell, up which Bannor\nclimbed steadily until after a hundred feet or more he reached another door.\nBeyond it, Covenant found himself in a jumbled maze of passageways, stairs, doors\nthat soon confused his sense of direction completely. Bannor led him this way\nand that at irregular intervals, up and down unmeasured flights of steps, along\nbroad and then narrow corridors, until he feared that he would not be able to\nmake his way out again without a guide. From time to time, he caught glimpses\nof other people, primarily Bloodguard and warriors, but he did not encounter\nany of them. At last, however, Bannor stopped in the middle of what appeared to\nbe a blank corridor. With a short gesture, he opened a hidden door. Covenant\nfollowed him into a large living chamber with a balcony beyond it.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Bannor waited while Covenant gave\nthe room a brief look, then said, &quot;Call if there is anything you\nrequire,&quot; and left, pulling the door shut behind him.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>For a moment, Covenant continued\nto glance around him; he took a mental inventory of the furnishings so that he\nwould know where all the dangerous corners, projections, edges were. The room\ncontained a bed, a bath, a table arrayed with food, chairs-one of which was\ndraped with a variety of apparel-and an arras on one wall. But none of these</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>presented any urgent threat, and\nshortly his gaze returned to the door.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>It had no handle, knob, latch,\ndraw-line-no means by which he could open it. What the hell-?</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>He shoved at it with his shoulder,\ntried to grip it by the edges and pull; he could not budge the heavy stone.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Bannor!&quot; With a wrench,\nhis mounting fear turned to anger. &quot;Bloody damnation! Bannor. Open this\ndoor!&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Almost immediately, the stone\nswung inward. Bannor stood impassively in the doorway. His flat eyes were\nexpressionless.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;I can't open the door,&quot;\nCovenant snapped. &quot;What is this? Some kind of prison?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Bannor's shoulders lifted\nfractionally. &quot;Call it what you choose. You must remain here until the\nLords are prepared to send for you.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot; `Until the Lords are\nprepared.' What am I supposed to do in the meantime? Just sit here and\nthink?&quot; &quot;Eat. Rest. Do whatever you will.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;I'll tell you what I will. I\nwill not stay here and go crazy waiting for the good pleasure of those Lords of\nyours. I came here all the way from Kevin's Watch to talk to them. I risked\nmy-&quot; With an effort, he caught himself. He could see that his fuming made\nno impression on the Bloodguard. He gripped his anger with both hands, and said\nstiffly, &quot;Why am I a prisoner?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Message-bearers may be\nfriends or foes,&quot; Bannor replied. &quot;Perhaps you are a servant of\nCorruption.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The safety of the Lords is in our\ncare. The Bloodguard will not permit you to endanger them. We will be sure of\nyou before we allow you to move freely.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Hellfire! Covenant swore. Just\nwhat I need. The room behind him seemed suddenly full of the dark, vulturine\nthoughts on which he had striven so hard to turn his back. How could he defend\nagainst them if he did not keep moving? But he could not bear to stand where he\nwas with all his fears exposed to Bannor's dispassionate scrutiny. He forced\nhimself to turn around. &quot;Tell them I don't like to wait.&quot; Trem bling,\nhe moved to the table and picked up a stoneware flask of springwine.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>When he heard the door close, he\ntook a long draft like a gesture of defiance. Then, with his teeth clenched on\nthe fine beery flavor of the springwine, he looked around the room again,\nglared about him as if he were daring dark specters to come out of hiding and\nattack.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>This time, the arras caught his\nattention. It was a thick, varicolored weaving, dominated by stark reds and sky\nblues, and after a moment's incomprehension he realized that it depicted the\nlegend of Berek Halfhand.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Prominent in the center stood the\nfigure of Berek in a stylized stance which combined striving and beatitude. And\naround this foreground were worked scenes encapsulating the Lord-Fatherer's\nhistory-his pure loyalty to his Queen, the King's greedy pursuit of power, the\nQueen's repudiation of her husband,</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Berek's exertions in the war, the\ncleaving of his hand, his despair on Mount Thunder, the victory of the\nFire-Lions. The effect of the whole was one of salvation, of redemption\npurchased on the very brink of ruin by rectitude-as if the Earth itself had\nintervened, could be trusted to intervene, to right the moral imbalance of the\nwar.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Oh, bloody hell! Covenant groaned.\nDo I have to put up with this?</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Clutching the stoneware flask as\nif it were the only solid thing in the room, he went toward the balcony. He\nstopped in the entryway, braced himself against the stone. Beyond the railing\nof the balcony was a fall of three or four hundred feet to the foothills. He\ndid not dare step out to the railing; already a premonition of giddiness gnawed\nlike nausea in his guts. But he made himself look outward long enough to\nidentify his surroundings.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The balcony was in the eastern\nface of the tower, overlooking a broad reach of plains. The late afternoon sun\ncast the shadow of the promontory eastward like an aegis, and in the subdued\nlight beyond the shadow the plains appeared various and colorful.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Bluish grasslands and plowed brown\nfields and newgreen crops intervaled each other into the distance, and between\nthem sun-silvered threads of streams ran east and south; the clustered spots of\nvillages spread a frail web of habitation over the fields; purple heather and\ngray bracken lay in broadening swaths toward the north. To his right, Covenant\ncould see far away the White River winding in the direction of Trothgard.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The sight reminded him of how he\nhad come to this place-of Foamfollower, Atiaran, Wraiths, Baradakas, a murdered\nWaynhim- A vertigo of memories gyred up out of the foothills at him. Atiaran\nhad blamed him for the slaughter of the Wraiths. And yet she had forsworn her\nown just desire for retribution, her just rage. He had done her so much harm.\nHe recoiled back into the chamber, stumbled to sit down at the table. His hands\nshook so badly that he could not drink from the flask. He set it down, clenched\nboth fists, and pressed his knuckles against the hard ring hidden over his\nheart.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>I will not think about it.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>A scowl like a contortion of the\nskull gripped his forehead. I am not Berek.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>He locked himself there until the\nsound of dangerous wings began to recede, and the giddy pain in his stomach\neased. Then he unclawed his stiff fingers. Ignoring their impossible\nsensitivity, he started to eat.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>On the table he found a variety of\ncold meats, cheeses, and fruits, with plenty of brown bread. He ate, deliberately,\nwoodenly, like a puppet acting out the commands of his will, until he was no\nlonger hungry. Then he stripped off his clothes and bathed, scrubbing himself\nthoroughly and scrutinizing his body to be sure he had no hidden wounds. He\nsorted through the clothing provided for him, finally donned a pale blue robe\nwhich he could tie closed securely to conceal his ring. Using Atiaran's knife,\nhe shaved meticulously. Then, with the same wooden deliberateness, he washed\nhis own clothes in the bath and hung them on chair backs to dry. All the time,\nhis thoughts ran to the rhythm of, I will not I am not</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>While he worked, evening drifted\nwestward over Revelstone, and when he was done he set a chair in the entrance\nto the balcony so that he could sit and watch the twilight without confronting\nthe height of his perch. But darkness appeared to spread outward from the unlit\nroom behind him into the wide world, as if his chamber were the source of\nnight. Before long, the empty space at his back seemed to throng with carrion\neaters.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>He felt in the depths of his heart\nthat he was becoming frantic to escape this dream.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The knock at his door jolted him,\nbut he yanked his way through the darkness to answer it. &quot;Come come\nin.&quot; In momentary confusion, he groped for a handle which was not there.\nThen the door opened to a brightness that dazzled him.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>At first, all he could see were\nthree figures, one back against the wall of the outer corridor and two directly\nin the doorway. One of them held a flaming wooden rod in either hand, and the\nother had each arm wrapped around a pot of graveling. The dazzle made them\nappear to loom toward him out of a penumbra, and he stepped back, blinking\nrapidly.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>As if his retreat were a welcome,\nthe two men entered his room. From behind them a voice curiously rough and\ngentle said, &quot;May we come in? I am Lord Mhoram-&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Of course,&quot; the taller\nof the two men interrupted in a voice veined and knuckled with old age.\n&quot;He requires light, does he not? Darkness withers the heart. How can he\nreceive light if we do not come in? Now if he knew anything, he could fend for\nhimself. Of course. And he will not see much of us. Too busy. There is yet\nVespers to attend to: The High Lord may have special instructions. We are late\nas it is. Because he knows nothing. Of course. But we are swift. Darkness\nwithers the heart. Pay attention,</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>young man. We cannot afford to\nreturn merely to redeem your ignorance.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>While the man spoke, jerking the\nwords like lazy servants up off the floor of his chest, Covenant's eyes\ncleared. Before him, the taller man resolved into an erect but ancient figure,\nwith a narrow face and a beard that hung like a tattered flag almost to his\nwaist. He wore a Woodhelvennin cloak bordered in blue, and a circlet of leaves\nabout his head.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>His immediate companion appeared\nhardly older than a boy. The youth was clad in a brown Stonedownor tunic with\nblue woven like epaulets into the shoulders, and he had a clean, merry face. He\nwas grinning at the old man in amusement and affection.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>As Covenant studied the pair, the\nman behind them said admonishingly, &quot;He is a guest, Birinair.&quot; The\nold man paused as if he were remembering his manners, and Covenant looked past\nhim at Lord Mhoram.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The Lord was a lean man about\nCovenant's height. He wore a long robe the color of High Lord's Furl, with a\npitch-black sash, and held a long staff in his right hand.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Then the old man cleared his\nthroat. &quot;Ah, very well,&quot; he fussed. &quot;But this uses time, and we\nare late. There is Vespers to be made ready. Preparations for the Council. Of\ncourse. You are a guest. Be welcome. I am Birinair, Hirebrand of the\nlillianrill and Hearthrall of Lord's Keep. This grinning whelp is Tohrm,\nGravelingas of the rhadhamaert and likewise Hearthrall of Lord's Keep. Now\nharken. Attend.&quot; In high dignity, he moved toward the bed. Above it in the\nwall was a torch socket. Birinair said, &quot;These are made for ignorant young\nmen like yourself,&quot; and set the burning end of one rod in the socket. The\nflame died; but when he removed the rod, its fire returned almost at once. He\nplaced the unlit end in the socket, then moved across the chamber to fix his\nother rod in the opposite wall.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>While the Hirebrand was busy,\nTohrm set one of his graveling pots down on the table and the other on the\nstand by the washbasin. &quot;Cover them when you wish to sleep,&quot; he said\nin a light voice.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>When he was done, Birinair said,\n&quot;Darkness with- the heart. Beware of it, guest.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;But courtesy is like a drink\nat a mountain stream,&quot; murmured Tohrm, grinning as if at a secret joke.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;It is so.&quot; Birinair\nturned and left the room. Tohrm paused to wink at Covenant and whisper,\n&quot;He is not as hard a taskmaster as you might think.&quot; Then he, too,\nwas gone, leaving Covenant alone with Lord Mhoram.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Mhoram closed the door behind him,\nand Covenant got his first good look at one of the Lords. Mhoram had a crooked,\nhumane mouth, and a fond smile for the Hearthralls lingered on his lips. But\nthe effect of the smile was counterbalanced by his eyes. They were dangerous\neyes-gray-blue irises flecked with goldthat seemed to pierce through subterfuge\nto the secret marrow of premeditation in what they beheld-eyes that seemed\nthemselves to conceal something potent and unknown, as if Mhoram were capable\nof surprising fate itself if he were driven to his last throw. And between his\nperilous eyes and kind mouth, the square blade of his nose mediated like a\nrudder, steering his thoughts.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Then Covenant noticed Mhoram's\nstaff. It was metal-shod like the Staff of Law, which he had glimpsed in\nDrool's spatulate fingers, but it was innocent of the carving that articulated\nthe Staff. Mhoram held it in his left hand while he gave Covenant the salute of\nwelcome with his right. Then he folded his arms on his chest, holding the staff\nin the crook of his elbow.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>His lips twisted through a combination\nof amusement, diffidence, and watchfulness as he spoke. &quot;Let me begin\nanew. I am Lord Mhoram son of Variol. Be welcome in Revelstone, Thomas\nCovenant,</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Unbeliever and message-bearer.\nBirinair is Hearthrall and chief lillianrill of Lord's Keep-but nevertheless\nthere is time before Vespers. So I have come for several reasons. First to bid\nyou welcome, second to answer the questions of a stranger in the Land-and last\nto inquire after the purpose which brings you to the Council. Pardon me if I\nseem formal. You are a stranger, and I know not how to honor you.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant wanted to respond. But he\nstill felt confused by darkness; he needed time to clear his head.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>He blinked at the Lord for a\nmoment, then said to fill the silence, &quot;That Bloodguard of yours doesn't\ntrust me.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Mhoram smiled wryly. &quot;Bannor\ntold me that you believe you have been emprisoned. That is also why I\ndetermined to speak with you this evening. It is not our custom to examine\nguests before they have rested. But I must say a word or two concerning the\nBloodguard. Shall we be seated?&quot; He took a chair for himself, sitting with\nhis staff across his knees as naturally as if it were a part of him.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant sat down by the table\nwithout taking his eyes off Mhoram. When he was settled, the Lord continued:\n&quot;Thomas Covenant, I tell you openly-I assume that you are a friend-or at\nleast not an enemy -until you are proven. You are a guest, and should be shown\ncourtesy. And we have sworn the Oath of Peace. But you are as strange to us as\nwe to you. And the Bloodguard have spoken a Vow which is not in any way like\nour Oath. They have sworn to serve the Lords and Revelstone-to preserve us\nagainst any threat by the strength of their fidelity.&quot; He sighed\ndistantly. &quot;Ah, it is humbling to be so served-in defiance of time and\ndeath. But let that pass. I must tell you two things. Left to the dictates of\ntheir Vow, the Bloodguard would slay you instantly if you raised your hand\nagainst any Lord-yes, against any inhabitant of Revelstone. But the Council of\nLords has commanded you to their care. Rather than break that command-rather\nthan permit any harm to befall you -Bannor or any Bloodguard would lay down his\nlife in your defense.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>When Covenant's face reflected his\ndoubt, the Lord said, &quot;I assure you. Perhaps it would be well for you to\nquestion Bannor concerning the Bloodguard. His distrust may not distress\nyou-when you have come to understand it. His people are the Haruchai, who live\nhigh in the Westron Mountains beyond the passes which we now name Guards Gap.\nIn the first years of Kevin Loric-son's High Lordship they came to the\nLand-came, and remained to make a Vow like that swearing which binds even the\ngods.&quot; For a moment, he seemed lost in contemplation of the Bloodguard.\n&quot;They were a hot-blooded people, strong-Joined and prolific, bred to\ntempest and battle-and now made by their pledged loyalty ascetic, womanless and\nold. I tell you, Thomas Covenant-their devotion has had such unforeseen prices-\nSuch one-mindedness does not come easily to them, and their only reward is the\npride of unbroken, pure service. And then to learn the bitterness of\ndoubt-&quot; Mhoram sighed again, then smiled diffidently. &quot;Inquire of\nBannor. I am too young to tell the tale aright.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Too young? Covenant wondered. How\nold are they? But he did not ask the question; he feared that the story Mhoram\ncould tell would be as seductive as Foamfollower's tale of the Unhomed. After a\nmoment, he pulled the loose ends of his attention together, and said,\n&quot;I've got to talk to the Council.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Mhoram's gaze met him squarely.\n&quot;The Lords will meet tomorrow to hear both you and Saltheart Foamfollower.\nDo you wish to speak now?&quot; The Lord's gold-flecked eyes seemed to flame\nwith concentration. Unexpectedly, he asked, &quot;Are you an enemy, Unbeliever?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant winced inwardly. He could\nfeel Mhoram's scrutiny as if its heat burned his mind. But he was determined to\nresist. Stiffly, he countered, &quot;You're the seer and oracle. You tell\nme.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Did Quaan call me\nthat?&quot; Mhoram's smile was disarming. &quot;Well, I showed prophetic astuteness\nwhen I let a mere red moon disquiet me. Perhaps my oracular powers amaze\nyou.&quot; Then he set aside his quiet self deprecation, and repeated intently,\n&quot;Are you an enemy?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant returned the Lord's gaze,\nhoping that his own eyes were hard, uncompromising. I will not- he thought. Am\nnot- &quot;I'm not anything to you by choice I've got-a message for you. One\nway or another, I've been pressured into bringing it here. And some things\nhappened along the way that might interest you.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Tell me,&quot; Mhoram said\nin soft urgency.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>But his look reminded Covenant of\nBaradakas-of Atiaran-of the times they had said, You are closed- He could see\nMhoram's health, his dangerous courage, his vital love for the Land.\n&quot;People keep asking me that,&quot; he murmured. &quot;Can't you tell?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>An instant later, he answered\nhimself, Of course not. What do they know about leprosy? Then he grasped the\nreason behind Mhoram's question. The Lord wanted to hear him talk, wanted his\nvoice to reveal his truth or falsehood. Mhoram's ears could discern the honesty\nor irrectitude of the answer.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant glanced at the memory of\nFoul's message, then turned away in self-defense. &quot;No-I'll save it for the\nCouncil. Once is enough for such things. My tongue'll turn to sand if I have,\nto say it twice.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Mhoram nodded as if in acceptance.\nBut almost immediately he asked, &quot;Does your message account for the\nbefouling of the moon?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Instinctively, Covenant looked out\nover his balcony.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>There, sailing tortuously over the\nhorizon like a plague ship, was the bloodstained moon. Its glow rode the plains\nlike an incarnadine phantasm. He could not keep the shudder out of his voice as\nhe replied. &quot;He's showing off-that's all. Just showing us what he can\ndo.&quot; Deep in his throat, he cried, Hellfirel Foul! The Wraiths were\nhelpless! What do you do for an encore, rape children?</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Ah,&quot; Lord-Mhoram\ngroaned, &quot;this comes at a bad time.&quot; He stepped away from his seat\nand pulled a wooden partition shut across the entrance to the balcony.\n&quot;The Warward numbers less than two thousand. The Bloodguard are only five\nhundred-a pittance for any task but the defense of Revelstone. And there are\nonly five Lords. Of those, two are old, at the limit of their strength, and\nnone have mastered more than the smallest part of Kevin's First Ward. We are\nweaker than any other Earthfriends in all the ages of the Land. Together we can\nhardly make scrub grass grow in Kurash Plenethor.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;There have been more,&quot;\nhe explained, returning to his seat, &quot;but in the last generation nearly\nall the best at the Loresraat have chosen the Rites of Unfettering. I am the\nfirst to pass the tests in fifteen years. Alas, it is in my heart that we will\nwant other power now.&quot; He clenched his staff until his knuckles whitened,</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>and for a moment his eyes did not\nconceal his sense of need.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Gruffly, Covenant said, &quot;Then\ntell your friends to brace themselves. You're not going to like what I've got\nto say.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>But Mhoram relaxed slowly, as if\nhe had not heard Covenant's warning. One finger at a time, he released his grip\nuntil the staff lay untouched in his lap. Then he smiled softly. &quot;Thomas\nCovenant, I am not altogether reasonless when I assume that you are not an\nenemy. You have a lillianrill staff and a rhadhamaerl knife-yes, and the staff\nhas seen struggle against a strong foe. And I have already spoken with\nSaltheart Foamfollower. You have been trusted by others. I do not think you\nwould have won your way here without trust.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Hellfire!&quot; retorted\nCovenant. &quot;You've got it backward.&quot; He threw his words like stones at\na false image of himself. &quot;They coerced me into coming. It wasn't my idea.\nI haven't had a choice since this thing started.&quot; With his fingers he\ntouched his chest to remind himself of the one choice he did have.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Unwilling,&quot; Mhoram\nreplied gently. &quot;So there is good reason for calling you `Unbeliever.'\nWell, let it pass. We will hear your tale at the Council tomorrow.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Now. I fear I have given\nyour questions little opportunity. But the time for Vespers has come. Will you\naccompany me? If you wish we will speak along the way.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant nodded at once. In spite\nof his weariness, he was eager for a chance to be active, keep his thoughts\nbusy. The discomfort of being interrogated eras only a little less than the\ndistress of the questions he wanted to ask about white gold. To escape his\ncomplicated vulnerabilities, he stood up and said, &quot;Lead the way.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The Lord bowed in acknowledgment,\nand at once preceded Covenant into the corridor outside his room. There they\nfound Bannor. He stood against the wall near the door with his arms folded\nstolidly across his chest, but he moved to join them as Mhoram and Covenant\nentered the passageway. On an impulse, Covenant intercepted him. He met\nBannor's gaze, touched the Bloodguard's chest with one rigid finger, and said,\n&quot;I don't trust you either.&quot; Then he turned in angry satisfaction back\nto the Lord.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Mhoram paused while Bannor went\ninto Covenant's room to pick up one of the torches. Then the Bloodguard took a\nposition a step behind Covenant's left shoulder, and Lord Mhoram led them down\nthe corridor. Soon Covenant was lost again; the complexities of the tower\nconfused him as quickly as a</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>maze. But in a short time they\nreached a hall which seemed to end in a dead wall of stone. Mhoram touched the\nstone with an end of his staff, and it swung inward, opening over the courtyard\nbetween the tower and the main Keep. From this doorway, a crosswalk stretched\nover to a buttressed coign.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant took one look at the\nyawning gulf of the courtyard, and backed away. &quot;No,&quot; he muttered,\n&quot;forget it. I'll just stay here if you don't mind.&quot; Blood rushed like\nshame into his face, and a rivulet of sweat ran coldly down his back. &quot;I'm\nno good at heights.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The Lord regarded him curiously\nfor a moment, but did not challenge his reaction. &quot;Very well,&quot; he\nsaid simply. &quot;We will go another way.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Sweating half in relief, Covenant\nfollowed as Mhoram retraced part of their way, then led a complex descent to\none of the doors at the base of the tower. There they crossed the courtyard.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Then for the first time Covenant\nwas in the main body of Revelstone.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Around him, the Keep was brightly\nlit with torches and graveling. Its walls were high and broad enough for\nGiants, and their spaciousness contrasted strongly with the convolution of the\ntower. In the presence of so much wrought, grand and magisterial granite, such\na weight of mountain rock spanning such open, illuminated halls, he felt\nacutely his own meagerness, his mere frail mortality. Once again, he sensed\nthat the makers of Revelstone had surpassed him.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>But Mhoram and Bannor did not\nappear meager to him. The Lord strode forward as if these halls were his\nnatural element, as if his humble flesh flourished in the service of this old\ngrandeur. And Bannor's personal solidity seemed to increase, as if he bore\nwithin him something that almost equaled Revelstone's permanence. Between them,\nCovenant felt half disincarnate, void of some essential actuality.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>A snarl jumped across his teeth,\nand his shoulders hunched as he strangled such thoughts. With a grim effort, he\nforced himself to concentrate on the superficial details around him.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>They turned down a hallway which\nwent straight but for gradual undulations, as if it were carved to suit the\ngrain of the rock-into the heart of the mountain. From it, connecting corridors\nbranched out at various intervals, some cutting directly across between cliff\nand cliff, and some only joining the central hall with the outer passages.\nThrough these corridors, a steadily growing number of men and women entered the\ncentral hall, all, Covenant guessed, going toward Vespers. Some wore the\nbreastplates and headbands of warriors; others, Woodhelvennin and Stonedownor\ngarb with which Covenant was familiar. Several struck him as being related in\nsome way to the lillianrill or rhadhamaerl; but many more seemed to belong to\nthe more prosaic occupations of running a city-cooking, cleaning, building,\nrepairing, harvesting.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Scattered through the crowd were a\nfew Bloodguard. Many of the people nodded and beamed respectfully at Lord\nMhoram, and he returned salutations in all directions, often hailing his\ngreeters by game. But behind him, Bannor carried the torch and walked as\ninflexibly as if he were alone in the Keep.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>As the throng thickened, Mhoram\nmoved toward the wall on one side, then stopped at a door. Opening he turned to\nBannor and said, &quot;I must join the High Lord. Take Thomas Covenant to a\nplace among the people in the sacred enclosure.&quot; To Covenant, he added,\n&quot;Bannor will bring you to the Close at the proper time tomorrow.&quot;\nWith a salute, he left Covenant with the Bloodguard.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Now Bannor led Covenant ahead\nthrough Revelstone. After some distance, the hall ended, split at right angles\nto arc left and right around a wide wall, and into this girdling corridor the\npeople poured from all directions. Doors large enough to admit Giants marked\nthe curved wall at regular intervals; through them the people passed briskly,\nbut without confusion or jostling.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>On either side of each door stood\na Gravelingas and a Hirebrand; and as Covenant neared one of the doors, he\nheard the door wardens intoning, &quot;If there is ill in your heart, leave it\nhere. There is no room for it within.&quot; Occasionally one of the people\nreached out and touched a warder as if handing over a burden.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>When he reached the door, Bannor\ngave his torch to the Hirebrand. The Hirebrand quenched it by humming a snatch\nof song and closing his hand over the flame. Then he returned the rod to\nBannor, and the Bloodguard entered the enclosure with Covenant behind him.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant found himself on a\nbalcony circling the inside of an enormous cavity. It held no lights, but\nillumination streamed into it from all the open doors, and there were six more\nbalconies above the one on which Covenant stood, all accessed by many open\ndoors. He could see clearly. The balconies stood in vertical tiers, and below\nthem, more than a hundred feet down, was the fiat bottom of the cavity. A dais\noccupied one side, but the rest of the bottom was full of people. The balconies\nalso were full, but relatively uncrowded; everyone had a full view of the dais\nbelow.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Sudden dizziness beat out of the\nair at Covenant's head. He clutched at the chest-high railing, braced his\nlaboring heart against it. Revelstone seemed full of vertigoes; everywhere he\nwent, he had to contend with cliffs, gulfs, abysms. But the rail was reassuring\ngranite. Hugging it, he fought down his fear, looked up to take his eyes away\nfrom the enclosure bottom.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>He was dimly surprised to find\nthat the cavity was not open to the sky; it ended in a vaulted dome several\nhundred feet above the highest balcony. The details of the ceiling were\nobscure, but he thought he could make out figures carved in the stone, giant\nforms vaguely dancing.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Then the light began to fail. One\nby one, the doors were being shut; as they closed, darkness filled the cavity\nlike recreated night. Soon the enclosure was sealed free of light, and into the\nvoid the soft moving noises and breathing of the people spread like a restless\nspirit. The blackness seemed to isolate Covenant. He felt as anchorless as if\nhe had been cast adrift in deep space, and the massive stone of the Keep\nimpended over him as if its sheer brute tonnage bore personally on the back of\nhis neck. Involuntarily, he leaned toward Bannor, touched the solid Bloodguard\nwith his shoulder.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Then a flame flared up on the\ndais-two flames, a lillianrill torch and a pot of graveling. Their lights were\ntiny in the huge cavity, but they revealed Birinair and Tohrm standing on\neither side of the dais, holding their respective fires. Behind each Hearthrall\nwere two blue-robed figures-Lord Mhoram with an ancient woman on his arm behind\nBirinair, and a woman and an old man behind Tohrm. And between these two groups\nstood another man robed in blue. His erect carriage denied the age of his white\nhair and beard. Intuitively, Covenant guessed, That's him-High Lord Prothall.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The man raised his staff and\nstruck its metal three times on the stone dais. He held his head high as he\nspoke, but his voice remembered that he was old. In spite of bold carriage and\nupright spirit, there was a rheumy ache of age in his tone as he said,\n&quot;This is the Vespers of Lord's Keep-ancient Revelstone,</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Giant-wrought bourne of all that\nwe believe. Be welcome, strong heart and weak, light and dark, blood and bone\nand thew and mind and soul, for good and all. Set Peace about you and within\nyou. This time is consecrate to the services of the Earth.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>His companions responded,\n&quot;Let there be healing and hope, heart and home, for the Land, and for all\npeople in the services of the Earth-for you before us, you direct participants\nin Earthpower and Lore, lillianrill and rhadhamaerl, learners, Lorewardens, and\nwarriors-and for you above us, you people and</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>daily carers of the hearth and\nharvest of life and for you among us, you Giants, Bloodguard, strangers-and for\nyou absent Ranyhyn and Ramen and Stonedownors and Woodhelvennin, all brothers\nand sisters. of the common troth. We are the Lords of the Land. Be welcome and\ntrue.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Then the Lords sang into the\ndarkness of the sacred enclosure. The Hearthrall fires were small in the huge,\nhigh, thronged sanctuary-small, and yet for all their smallness distinct,\ncynosural, like uncorrupt courage.

Seven Words for ill's despite Banes for evil's dooming wight:</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>And one pure Lord to hold the\nStaff To bar the Land from Foul's betraying sight.

And sworn and\ndedicated as well, in equal balance with all other consecrations and promises\nsworn despite any urging of the importunate self-to the Oath of Peace. For\nserenity is the only promise we can give that we will not desecrate the Land\nagain.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The people standing before the\ndais replied in unison, &quot;We will not redesecrate the Land, though the\neffort of self mastery wither us on the vine of our lives. Nor will we rest\nuntil the shadow of our former folly is lifted from the Land's heart, and the\ndarkness is whelmed in growth and life.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>And Prothall returned, &quot;But\nthere is no withering in the service of the Land. Service enables service, just\nas servility perpetuates debasement. We may go from knowledge to knowledge, and\nto still braver knowledge, if courage holds, and commitment holds, and wisdom\ndoes not fall under the shadow. We are the new preservers of the Land-votaries\nand handservants to the EarthpFoowr ewr.e will not rest</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>not turn aside, lose faith, or\nfail until the Gray flows Blue, and Rill and Maerl are as new and clean as\nancient Llurallin.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>To this the entire assembly\nresponded by singing the same words, line by line, after the High Lord; and the\nmassed communal voice reverberated in the sacred enclosure as if his rheumy\ntone had tapped some pent, subterranean passion. While the mighty sound lasted,\nProthall bowed his head in humility.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>But when it was over, he threw\nback his head and flung his arms wide as if baring his breast to a\ndenunciation. &quot;Ah, my friends!&quot; he cried. &quot;Handservants,\nvotaries of the Land-why have we so failed to comprehend Kevin's Lore? Which of\nus has in any way advanced the knowledge of our predecessors? We hold the First\nWard in our hands-we read the script, and is much we understand the words-and\nyet we do not penetrate the secrets. Some failure in us, some false inflection,\nsome mistaken action,</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>some base alloy in our intention,\nprevents. I do not doubt that our purpose is pure-it is High Lord Kevin's\npurpose-and before him Loric's and Damelon's and Heartthew's-but wiser, for we\nwill never lift our hands against the Land in mad despair. But what, then?\nWhere are we wrong, that we cannot grasp what is given to us?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>For a moment after his voice\nfaltered and fell, the sanctuary was silent, and the void throbbed like\nweeping, as if in his words the people recognized themselves, recognized the\nfailure he described as their own. But then a new voice arose. Saltheart\nFoamfollower said boldly, &quot;My Lord, we have not reached our end. True, the\nwork of our lifetime has been to comprehend and consolidate the gains of our\nforebearers. But our labor will open the doors of the future. Our children and\ntheir children will gain because we have not lost heart, for faith and courage\nare the greatest gift that we can give to our descendants. And the Land holds\nmysteries of which we know nothing mysteries of hope as well as of peril. Be of\ngood heart, Rockbrothers. Your faith is precious above all things:&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>But you don't have time! Covenant\ngroaned. Faith! Children! Foul is going to destroy you. Within him, his\nconception of the Lords whirled, altered. They were not superior beings,\nfate-shapers; they were mortals like himself, familiar with impotence. Foul\nwould reave them For an instant, he released the railing as if he meant to cry\nout his message of doom to the gathered people. But at once vertigo broke\nthrough his resistance, pounced at him out of the void. Reeling, he stumbled\nagainst the rail, then fell back to clutch at Bannor's shoulder.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>that the uttermost limit of their\nspan of days upon the Land He would have to read them their death warrant.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Get me out of here,&quot; he\nbreathed hoarsely. &quot;I can't stand it.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Bannor held him, guided him.\nAbruptly, a door opened into the brilliance of the outer corridor. Covenant\nhalf fell through the doorway. Without a word,. Bannor refit his torch at one\nof the flaming brands set into the wall. Then he took Covenant's arm to support\nhim.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant threw off his hand.\n&quot;Don't touch me,&quot; he panted inchoately. &quot;Can't you see I'm\nsick?&quot; No flicker of expression shaded Bannor's fiat countenance.\nDispassionately, he turned and led Covenant away from the sacred enclosure.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant followed, bent forward\nand holding his stomach as if he were nauseated. -that the uttermost</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>limit- How could he help them? He\ncould not even help himself. In confusion and heart distress, he shambled back\nto his room in the tower, stood dumbly in the chamber while Bannor replaced his\ntorch and left, closing the door like a judgment behind him. Then he gripped\nhis temples as if his mind were being torn in two.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>None of this is happening, he\nmoaned. How are they doing this to me?</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Reeling inwardly, he turned to\nlook at the arras as if it might contain some answer. But it only aggravated\nhis distress, incensed him like a sudden affront. Bloody hell! Berek, he\ngroaned. Do you think it's that easy? Do you think that ordinary human despair\nis enough, that if you just feel bad enough something cosmic or at least\nmiraculous is bound to come along and rescue you? Damn you! he's going to\ndestroy them! You're just another leper outcast unclean, and you don't even\nknow it!</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>His fingers curled like feral\nclaws, and he sprang forward, ripping at the arms as if he were trying to rend\na black lie off the stone of the world. The heavy fabric refused to tear in his\nhalf-unfingered grasp, but he got it down from the wall. Throwing open the\nbalcony, he wrestled the arras out into the crimson tainted night and heaved it\nover the railing. It fell like a dead leaf of winter.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>I am not Berek!</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Panting at his effort, he returned\nto the room, slammed the partition shut against the bloody light.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>He threw off his robe, put on his\nown underwear, then extinguished the fires and climbed into bed. But the soft,\nclean touch of the sheets on his skin gave him no consolation.<br clear=all\nstyle='page-break-before:always'>\n</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><a name=\"_Toc370739019\"><span class=Heading1Char><span\nstyle='font-size:16.0pt;line-height:105%'>FOURTEEN: The Council of Lords</span></span></a></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>He awoke in a dull haze which felt\nlike the presage of some thunderhead, some black boil and white fire blaring.\nMechanically he went through the motions of readying himself for the\nCouncil-washed, inspected himself, dressed in his own clothes, shaved again.\nWhen Bannor brought him a tray of food, he ate as if the provender were made of\ndust and gravel. Then he slipped Atiaran's knife into his belt, gripped the\nstaff of Baradakas in his left hand, and sat down facing the door to await the\nsummons.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Finally, Bannor returned to tell\nhim that the time had come. For a few moments, Covenant sat still, holding the\nBloodguard in his half-unseeing gaze, and wondering where he could get the\ncourage to go on with this dream. He felt that his face was twisted, but he\ncould not be sure.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>-that the uttermost limit Get it\nover with.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>He touched the hard, hidden metal of\nhis ring to steady himself, then levered his reluctant bones erect. Glaring at\nthe doorway as if it were a threshold into peril, he lumbered through it and\nstarted down the corridor. At Bannor's commanding back, he moved out of the\ntower, across the courtyard, then inward and down through the raveled and\ncuriously wrought passages of Revelstone.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Eventually they came through\nbright-lit halls deep in the mountain to a pair of arching wooden doors. These\nwere closed, sentried by Bloodguard; and lining both walls were stone chairs,\nsome man-sized and others large enough for Giants. Bannor nodded to the\nsentries. One of them pulled open a door while the other motioned for Bannor\nand Covenant to enter. Bannor guided Covenant into the council chamber of the\nLords.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The Close was a huge, sunken,\ncircular room with a ceiling high and groined, and tiers of seats set around\nthree quarters of the space. The door through which Covenant entered was nearly\nlevel with the highest seats, as were the only two other doors-both of them\nsmall-at the opposite side of the chamber. Below the lowest tier of seats were\nthree levels: on the first, several feet below the gallery, stood a curved\nstone table, three-quarters round, with its gap toward the large doors and many\nchairs around its outer edge; below this, contained within the C of the table,\nwas the flat floor of the Close; and finally, in the center of the floor, lay a\nbroad, round pit of graveling. The yellow glow of the fire-stones was supported\nby four huge lillianrill torches, burning without smoke or consumption in their\nsockets around the upper wall.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>As Bannor took him down the steps\ntoward the open end of the table, Covenant observed the people in the chamber.\nSaltheart Foamfollower lounged nearby at the table in a massive stone chair; he\nwatched Covenant's progress down the steps and grinned a welcome for his former\npassenger. Beyond him, the only people at the table were the Lords. Directly\nopposite Covenant, at the head of the table, sat High Lord Prothall. His staff\nlay on the stone before dim. An ancient man and woman were several feet away on\neither side of him; an equal distance from the woman on her left was Lord\nMhoram; and opposite Mhoram, down the table from the old man, sat a middle-aged\nwoman. Four Bloodguard had positioned themselves behind each of the Lords.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>There were only four other people\nin the Close. Beyond the High Lord near the top of the gallery sat the\nHearthralls, Birinair and Tohrm, side by side as if they complemented each\nother. And just behind them were two more men, one a warrior with a double\nblack diagonal on his breastplate, and the other Tuvor, First Mark of the\nBloodguard. With so few people in it, the Close seemed large, hollow, and\ncryptic.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Bannor steered Covenant to the\nlone chair below the level of the Lords' table and across the pit of graveling\nfrom the High Lord. Covenant seated himself stiffly and looked around. He felt\nthat he was uncomfortably far from the Lords; he feared he would have to shout\nhis message. So he was surprised when Prothall stood and said softly,\n&quot;Thomas Covenant, be welcome to the Council of Lords.&quot; His rheumy\nvoice reached Covenant as clearly as if they had been standing side by side.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant did not know how to\nrespond; uncertainly, he touched his right fist to his chest, then extended his\narm with his palm open and forward. As his senses adjusted to the Close, he\nbegan to perceive the presence, the emanating personality and adjudication, of\nthe Lords. They gave him an impression of stern vows gladly kept, of wide-ranging\nand yet singleminded devotion. Prothall stood alone, meeting Covenant's gaze.\nThe High Lord's appearance of white age was modified by the stiffness of his\nbeard and the erectness of his carriage; clearly, he was strong yet. But his\neyes were worn with the experience of an asceticism, an abnegation, carried so\nfar that it seemed to abrogate his flesh-as if he had been old for so long that\nnow only the power to which he devoted himself preserved him from decrepitude.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The two Lords who flanked him were\nnot so preserved. They had dull, age-marked skin and wispy hair; and they bowed\nat the table as if striving against the antiquity of their bones to distinguish\nbetween meditation and sleep. Lord Mhoram Covenant already knew, though now\nMhoram appeared more incisive and dangerous, as if the companionship of his\nfellow Lords whetted his capacities. But the fifth</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Lord Covenant did not know; she\nsat squarely and factually at the table, with her blunt, forthright face fixed\non him like a defiance.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Let me make introduction\nbefore we begin,&quot; the High Lord murmured. &quot;I am Prothall son of\nDwillian, High Lord by the choice of the Council. At my right are Variol\nTamarantha-mate and Pentil-son, once High Lord&quot;-as he said this, the two\nancient Lords raised their time-latticed faces and smiled privately at each\nother-&quot;and Osondrea daughter of Sondrea. At my left, Tamarantha\nVariol-mate and Enesta-daughter, and Mhoram son of Variol. You know the\nSeareach Giant, Saltheart Foamfollower,</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>and have met the Hearthralls of Lord's\nKeep. Behind me also are Tuvor, First Mark of the Bloodguard, and Garth,\nWarmark of the Warward of Lord's Keep. All have the right of presence at the\nCouncil of Lords. Do you protest?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Protest? Covenant shook his head\ndumbly.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Then we shall begin. It is\nour custom to honor those who come before us. How may we honor you?&quot;\nAgain, Covenant shook his head. I don't want any honor. I made that mistake\nonce already.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>After an inquiring pause, the High\nLord said, &quot;Very well.&quot; Turning toward the Giant, he raised his\nvoice. &quot;Hail and welcome, Giant of Seareach, Saltheart Foamfollower,\nRockbrother and inheritor of Land's loyalty. The Unhomed are a blessing to the\nLand. Stone and Sea are deep in life.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Welcome whole or hurt, in boon or\nbane-ask or give. To any requiring name we will not fail while we have life or\npower to meet the need. I am High Lord Prothall; I speak in the presence of\nRevelstone itself.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Foamfollower stood to return the\nsalutation. &quot;Hail, Lord and Earthfriend. I am Saltheart Foamfollower,</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>legate from the Giants of Seareach\nto the Council of Lords. The truth of my people is in my mouth, and I hear the\napproval of the ancient sacred ancestral stone raw Earth rockpure friendship a\nhandmark of allegiance and fealty in the eternal stone of time. Now is the time\nfor proof and power of troth. Through Giant Woods and Sarangrave Flat and\nAndelain, I bear the name of the ancient promises.&quot; Then some of the\nformality dropped from his manner, and he added with a gay glance at Covenant,\n&quot;And bearing other things as well. My friend Thomas Covenant has promised\nthat a song will be made of my journey.&quot; He laughed gently. &quot;I am a\nGiant of Seareach. Make no short songs for me.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>His humor drew a chuckle from Lord\nMhoram, and Prothall smiled softly; but Osondrea's dour face seemed incapable\nof laughter, and neither Variol nor Tamarantha appeared to have heard the\nGiant. Foamfollower took his seat, and almost at once Osondrea said as if she\nwere impatient, &quot;What is your embassy?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Foamfollower sat erect in his\nchair, and his hands stroked the stone of the table intently. &quot;My Lords\nStone and Sea! I am a Giant. These matters do not come easily, though easier to\nme than to any of my kindred-and for that reason I was chosen. But I will\nendeavor to speak hastily.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Please understand me. I was\ngiven my embassy in a Giantclave lasting ten days. There was no waste of time.\nWhen comprehension is needed, all tales must be told in full. Haste is for the\nhopeless, we say-and</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>hardly a day has passed since I\nlearned that there is truth in sayings. So it is that my embassy contains much\nthat you would not choose to hear at present. You must know the history of my\npeoples-all the sojourn and the loss which brought us ashore here, all the\ninteractions of our peoples since that age-if you are to hear me. But I will\nforgo it. We are the Unhomed, adrift in soul and lessened by an unreplenishing\nseed. We are hungry for our native land. Yet since the time of Damelon\nGiantfriend we have not surrendered hope, though Soulcrusher himself contrives\nagainst us. We have searched the seas, and have waited for the omens to come to\npass.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Foamfollower paused to look\nthoughtfully at Covenant, then went on: &quot;Ah, my Lords, omening is curious.\nSo much is said-and so little made clear. It was not Home that Damelon foretold\nfor us, but rather an end, a resolution, to our loss. Yet that sufficed for\nus-sufficed.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Well. One hope we have found\nfor ourselves. When spring came to Seareach, our questing ships returned, and\ntold that at the very limit of their search they came upon an isle that borders\nthe ancient oceans on which we once roamed. The matter is not sure, but our\nnext questers can go directly to this isle and look beyond it for surer signs.\nThus across the labyrinth of the seas we unamaze ourselves.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Prothall nodded, and through the\nperfect acoustics of the Close, Covenant could hear the faint rustle of the\nHigh Lord's robe.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>With an air of nearing the crux of\nhis embassy, Foamfollower continued, &quot;Yet another hope we received from\nDamelon Giantfriend, High Lord and Heartthew's son. At the heart of his omening\nwas this word: our exile would end when our seed regained its potency, and the\ndecline of our offspring was reversed.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Thus hope is born of hope, for\nwithout any foretelling we would gain heart and courage from any increase in\nour rare, beloved children. And behold! On the night that our ships returned,\nWavenhair Haleall, wived to Sparlimb Keelsetter, was taken to her bed and\ndelivered-ah, Stone and Sea, my Lords! It cripples my tongue to tell this\nwithout its full measure of long Giantish gratitude. How can there he joy for\npeople who say everything briefly? Proud-wife, clean-limbed Wavenhair gave\nbirth to three sons.&quot; No longer able to restrain himself, he broke into a\nchant full of the brave crash of breakers and the tang of salt.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>To his surprise, Covenant saw that\nLord Osondrea was smiling, and her eyes caught the golden glow of the graveling\ndamply-eloquent witness to the gladness of the Giant's news.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>But Foamfollower abruptly stopped\nhimself. With a gesture toward Covenant, he said, &quot;Your pardon you have\nother matters in your hands. I must bring myself to the bone of my embassy. Ah,\nmy friend,&quot; he said to Covenant, &quot;will you still not laugh for me? I\nmust remember that Damelon promised us an end, not a return Home-though I\ncannot envision any end but Home. It may be that I stand in the gloaming of the\nGiants.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Hush, Rockbrother,&quot;\nLord Tamarantha interrupted. &quot;Do not make evil for your people by uttering\nsuch things.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Foamfollower responded with a\nhearty laugh. &quot;Ah, my thanks, Lord Tamarantha. So the wise old Giants are\nadmonished by young women. My entire people will laugh when I tell them of\nthis.&quot; Tamarantha and Variol exchanged a smile, and returned to their\nsemblance of meditation or dozing.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>When he was done laughing, the\nGiant said, &quot;Well, my Lords. To the bone, then. Stone and Sea! Such haste\nmakes me giddy. I have come to ask the fulfillment of the ancient offers. High\nLord Loric Vilesilencer promised that the Lords would give us a gift when our hope\nwas ready-a gift to better the chances of our Homeward way.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Birinair,&quot; said Lord\nOsondrea.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>High in the gallery behind\nProthall, old Birinair stood and replied, &quot;Of course. I am not asleep. Not\nas old as I look, you know. I hear you.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>With a broad grin, Foamfollower\ncalled, &quot;Hail, Birinair! Hearthrall of Lord's Keep and Hirebrand of the\nlillianrill. We are old friends, Giants and lillianrill.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;No need to shout,&quot;\nBirinair returned. &quot;I hear you. Old friends from the time of High Lord\nDamelon. Never otherwise.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Birinair,&quot; Osondrea cut\nin, &quot;does your lore recall the gift promised by Loric to the Giants?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Gift? Why not? Nothing amiss\nwith my memory. Where is that whelp my apprentice? Of course. Lorliarill.\nGildenlode, they call it. There. Keels and rudders for ships. True course-never\nbecalmed. And strong as stone,&quot; he said to Tohrm, &quot;you grinning\nrhadhamaerl to the contrary. I remember.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Can you accomplish\nthis?&quot; Osondrea asked quietly. &quot;Accomplish?&quot; Birinair echoed,\napparently puzzled.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Can you make Gildenlode\nkeels and rudders for the Giants? Has that lore been lost?&quot; Turning to\nFoamfollower, Lord Osondrea asked, &quot;How many ships will you need?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>With a glance at Birinair's\nupright dignity, Foamfollower contained his humor, and replied simply,\n&quot;Seven. Perhaps five.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Can this be done?&quot;\nOsondrea asked Birinair again, distinctly but without irritation. Covenant's\nblank gaze followed from speaker to speaker as if they were talking in a\nforeign language.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The Hearthrall pulled a small\ntablet and stylus from his robe and began to calculate, muttering to himself.\nThe scrape of his stylus could be heard throughout the Close until he raised\nhis head and said stiffly, &quot;The lore remains. But not easily. The best we\ncan do. Of course. And time-it will need time. Bodach glas, it will need\ntime.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;How much time?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;The best we can do. If we\nare left alone. Not my fault. I did not lose all the proudest lore of the\nlillianrill. Forty years.&quot; In a sudden whisper, he added to Foamfollower,\n&quot;I am sorry.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Forty years?&quot;\nFoamfollower laughed gently. &quot;Ah, bravely said, Birinair, my friend. Forty\nyears? That does not seem a long time to me.&quot; Turning to High Lord\nProthall, he said, &quot;My people cannot thank you. Even in Giantish, there\nare no words long enough. &quot;Three millenia of our loyalty have not been\nenough 1v repay seven Gildenlode keels and rudders.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;No,&quot; protested\nProthall. &quot;Seventy times seven Gildenlode gifts are nothing compared to\nthe great headship of the Seareach Giants. Only the thought we have aided your\nreturn Home can fill the emptiness your departure will leave. And our help is\nfourty years distant. But we will begin at once, and it may be that some new\nunderstanding of Kevin's Lore will shorten the time.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Echoing, &quot;At once,&quot;\nBirinair reseated himself.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Forty years? Covenant breathed.\nYou don't have forty years.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Then Osondrea said,\n&quot;Done?&quot; She looked first at Foamfollower, then at High Lord Prothall.\nWhen they both nodded to her, she turned on Covenant and said, &quot;Then let\nus get to the matter of this Thomas Covenant.&quot; Her voice seemed to whet\nthe atmosphere like a distant thunderclap.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Smiling to ameliorate Osondrea's\nforthrightness, Mhoram said, &quot;A stranger called the Unbeliever.&quot;\n&quot;And for good reason,&quot; Foamfollower added.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The Giant's words rang an alarm in\nCovenant's clouded trepidations, and he looked sharply at Foamfollower. In the\nGiant's cavernous eyes and buttressed forehead, he saw the import of the\ncomment. As clearly as if he were pleading outright, Foamfollower said,\nAcknowledge the white gold and use it to aid the Land. Impossible, Covenant\nreplied. The backs of his eyes felt hot with helplessness and belligerence, but\nhis face was as stiff as a marble slab.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Abruptly, Lord Osondrea demanded,\n&quot;The tapestry from your room was found. Why did you cast it down?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Without looking at her, Covenant\nanswered, &quot;It offended me.&quot; &quot;Offended?&quot; Her voice quivered\nwith disbelief and indignation. &quot;Osondrea,&quot; Prothall admonished\ngently. &quot;He is a stranger.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>She kept the defiance of her face\non Covenant, but fell silent. For a moment, no one moved or spoke; Covenant\nreceived the unsettling impression that the Lords were debating mentally with\neach other about how to treat him. Then Mhoram stood, walked around the end of\nthe stone table, and moved back inside the circle until he was again opposite\nOsondrea. There he seated himself on the edge of the table with his staff\nacross his lap, and fixed his eyes down on Covenant.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant felt more exposed than\never to Mhoram's scrutiny. At the same time, he sensed that Bannor had stepped\ncloser to him, as if anticipating an attack on Mhoram.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Wryly, Lord Mhoram said,\n&quot;Thomas Covenant, you must pardon our caution. The desecrated moon\nsignifies an evil in the Land which we hardly suspected. Without warning, the\nsternest test of our age appears in the sky, and we are utterly threatened. Yet\nwe do not prejudge you. You must prove your ill-if ill you are.&quot; He looked\nto Covenant for some response, some acknowledgment, but Covenant only stared\nback emptily. With a slight shrug, the Lord went on, &quot;Now. Perhaps it\nwould be well if you began with your message.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant winced, ducked his head\nlike a man harried by vultures. He did not want to recite that message, did not\nwant to remember Kevin's Watch, Mithil Stonedown, anything. His guts ached at\nvisions of vertigo. Everything was impossible. How could he retain his outraged\nsanity if he thought about such things?</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>But Foul's message had a power of\ncompulsion. He had borne it like a wound in his mind too long to repudiate it\nnow. Before he could muster any defense, it came over him like a convulsion. In\na tone of irremediable contempt, he said, &quot;These are the words of Lord\nFoul the Despiser.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Say to the Council of Lords,\nand to, the High Lord Prothall son of Dwillian, that the uttermost limit of\ntheir span of days upon the Land is seven times seven years from this present\ntime. Before the end of those days are numbered, I will have the command of\nfife and death in my hand. And as a token that what I say is the one word of\ntruth, tell them this: Drool Rockworm, Cavewight of Mount Thunder, has found\n!he Staff of Law, which was lost ten times a hundred years ago by Kevin at the\nRitual of Desecration. Say to them that the task appointed to their generation\nis ors regain the Staff. Without it,</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>they will not be able to gist me\nfor seven years, and my complete victory will be achieved six times seven years\nearlier than it would be else.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot; `As for you, groveler: do\nnot fail with this message. If you do not bring it before the Council, then\nevery human in the Land will be dead before ten seasons have passed. You do not\nunderstand-but I tell you Drool Rockworm has the Staff, and that is a cause for\nterror. He will be enthroned at Lord's Keep in two years if the message fails.\nAlready, the Cavewights are marching to his call; and wolves, and ur-viles of\nthe Demondim, answer the power of the Staff. But war is not the worst peril.\nDrool delves ever deeper into the dark roots of Mount Thunder-Gravin Threndor,\nPeak of the Fire Lions. And there are banes buried in the deeps of the Earth\ntoo potent and terrible for any mortal to control. They would make of the\nuniverse a hell forever. But such a bane Drool seeks. He searches for the\nIllearth Stone. If he becomes its master, there will be woe for low and high\nalike until Time itself falls.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;'Do not fail with my\nmessage, groveler. You have met Drool. Do you relish dying in his hands?&quot;'\nCovenant's heart lurched with the force of his loathing for the words, the\ntone. But he was not done. &quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>`One word more, a final caution.\nDo not forget whom to fear at the last. I have had to be content with killing\nand torment. But now my plans are laid, and I have begun. I shall not rest\nuntil I have eradicated hope from the Earth. Think on that, and be\ndismayed!&quot;' As he finished, he heard fear and abhorrence flare in the\nClose as if ignited by his involuntary peroration. Hellfire hellfire! he\nmoaned, trying to clear his gaze of the darkness from which Foul's contempt had\nsprung. Unclean!</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Prothall's head was bowed, and he\nclenched his staff as if he were trying to wring courage from it. Behind him,\nTuvor and Warmark Garth stood in attitudes of martial readiness. Oddly, Variol\nand Tamarantha doddered in their seats as if dozing, unaware of what had been\nsaid. But Osondrea gaped at Covenant as if he had stabbed her in the heart.\nOpposite her, Mhoram stood erect, head high and eyes closed, with his staff\nbraced hard against the floor; and where his metal met the stone, a hot blue\nflame burned. Foamfollower hunched in his seat; his huge hands clutched a stone\nchair. His shoulders quivered, and suddenly the chair snapped.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>At the noise, Osondrea covered her\nface with her hands, gave one stricken cry, &quot;Melenkurion abatha!&quot; The\nnext instant, she dropped her hands and resumed her stony, amazed stare at\nCovenant. And he shouted, Unclean! as if he were agreeing with her.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Laugh, Covenant,&quot;\nFoamfollower whispered hoarsely. &quot;You have told us the end of all things.\nNow help us. Laugh.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant replied dully, &quot;You\nlaugh. `Joy is in the ears that hear.' I can't do it.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>To his astonishment, Foamfollower\ndid laugh. He lifted his head and made a strangled, garish noise in his throat\nthat sounded like sobbing; but in a moment the sound loosened, clarified,\nslowly took on the tone of indomitable humor. The terrible exertion appalled Covenant.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>As Foamfollower laughed, the first\nshock of dismay passed from the Council. Gradually, Prothall raised his head.\n&quot;The Unhomed are a blessing to the Land,&quot; he murmured. Mhoram sagged,\nand the fire between his staff and the floor went out. Osondrea shook her head,\nsighed, passed her hands through her hair. Again, Covenant sensed a kind of\nmental melding from the Lords; without words, they seemed to join hands, share\nstrength with each other.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Sitting alone and miserable,\nCovenant waited for them to question him. And as he waited, he struggled to\nrecapture all the refusals on which his survival depended.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Finally, the Lords returned their\nattention to him. The flesh of Prothall's face seemed to droop with weariness,\nbut his eyes remained steady, resolute. stow, Unbeliever,&quot; he said softly.\n&quot;You must tell us all that has happened to you. We must know how Lord\nFoul's threats are embodied.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Now, Covenant echoed, twisting in\nhis chair. He could hardly resist a desire to clutch at his ring. Dark memories\nbeat at his ears, trying to break down his defenses. Shortly, everyone in the\nClose was looking at him. Tossing his words down as if he were discarding\nflawed bricks, he began.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;I come from-someplace else.\nI was brought to Kevin's Watch-I don't know how. First I got a look at\nDrool-then Foul left me on the Watch. They seemed to know each other.&quot;\n&quot;And the Staff of Law?&quot; Prothall asked.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Drool had a staff-all carved\nup, with metal ends like yours. I don't know what it was.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Prothall shrugged the doubt away;\nand grimly Covenant forced himself to describe without any personal mention of\nhimself, any reference to Lena or Triock or Baradakas, the events of his\njourney. When he spoke of the murdered Waynhim, Osondrea's breath hissed\nbetween her teeth, but the Lords made no other response.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Then, after he mentioned the visit\nto Soaring Woodhelven of a malicious stranger, possibly a Raver, Mhoram asked\nintently, &quot;Did the stranger use a name?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;He said his name was\nJehannum.&quot; &quot;Ah. And what was his purpose?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;How should I know?&quot;\nCovenant rasped, trying to conceal his falsehood with belligerence. &quot;I\ndon't know any Ravers.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Mhoram nodded noncommittally, and\nCovenant went on to relate his and Atiaran's progress through Andelain. He\navoided gruffly any reference to the wrong which had attacked him through his\nboots. But when he came to the Celebration of Spring, he faltered.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The Wraiths-! he ached silently.\nThe rage and horror of that night were still in him, still vivid to his raw\nheart. Covenant, help them! How could I? It's madness! I'm not-I am not Berek.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>With an effort that made his\nthroat hurt as if his words were too sharp to pass through it, he said,\n&quot;The Celebration was attacked by ur-viles. We escaped. Some of the Wraiths\nwere saved by-by one of the Unfettered, Atiaran said. Then the moon turned red.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Then we got to the river and met\nFoamfollower. Atiaran decided to go back home. How the hell much</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>longer do I have to put up with\nthis?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Unexpectedly, Lord Tamarantha\nraised her nodding head. &quot;Who will go?&quot; she asked toward the ceiling\nof the Close.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;It has not yet been\ndetermined that anyone will go,&quot; Prothall replied in a gentle voice.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Nonsense,&quot; she sniffed.\nTugging at a thin wisp of hair behind her ear, she coaxed her old bones erect.\n&quot;This is too high a matter for caution. We must act. Of course I trust\nhim. He has a Hirebrand's staff, does he not? What Hirebrand would give a staff\nwithout sure reason? And look at it-one end blackened. He has fought with it-at\nthe Celebration, if I do not mistake. Ah, the poor Wraiths. That was ill,\nill.&quot; Looking across at Variol, she said, &quot;Come. We must\nprepare.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Variol worked himself to his feet.\nTaking Tamarantha's arm, he left the Close through one of the doors behind the\nHigh Lord.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>After a respectful pause for the\nold Lords, Osondrea leveled her stare at Covenant and demanded, &quot;How did\nyou gain that staff?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Baradakas-the Hirebrand-gave\nit to me.&quot; &quot;Why?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Her tone sparked his anger.

He tested everyone.&quot; &quot;Did he\nalso test Atiaran?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;What do you think?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;I think,&quot; Foamfollower\ninterposed firmly, &quot;that Atiaran Trell-mate of Mithil Stonedown would not\nrequire any test of truth to demonstrate her fidelity.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>This affirmation produced a pause,\nduring which tie Lords looked at each other as if they had reached an impasse.\nThen High Lord Prothall said sternly, &quot;Thomas Covenant, you are a\nstranger, and we have had no time to learn your ways. But we will not surrender\nour sense of what is right to you. It is clear th you have spoken falsehood.\nFor the sake of the Land, you must answer our questions. Please tell us why the\nHirebrand Baradakas gave to you the test of truth, but not to Atiaran your\ncompanion.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;No.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Then tell us why Atiaran\nTrell-mate chose not to accompany you here. It is rare for a person born of the\nLand to stop short of Revelstone.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;No.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Why do you refuse?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant glared seething up at his\ninterrogators. They sat above him like judges with the power of outcasting in\ntheir hands. He wanted to defend himself with shouts, curses; but the Lords'\nintent eyes stopped him. He could see no contempt in their faces. They regarded\nhim with anger, fear, disquietude, with offended love for the Land, but no\ncontempt. Very softly, he said, &quot;Don't you understand? I'm trying to get\nout of telling you an even bigger lie. If you keep pushing me-we'll all\nsuffer.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The High Lord met his irate,\nsupplicating gaze for a moment, then sighed catarrhally, &quot;Very well. You\nmake matters difficult for us. Now we must deliberate. Please leave the Close.\nWe will call for you in a short time.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant stood, turned on his\nheel, started up the steps toward the big doors. Only the sound .of his boots\nagainst the stone marked the silence until he had almost reached the doors.\nThen he heard Foamfollower say as clearly as if his own heart uttered the\nwords, &quot;Atiaran Trell-mate blamed you for the slaughter of the\nWraiths.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>He froze, waiting in blank dread\nfor the Giant to continue. But Foamfollower said nothing more. Trembling,\nCovenant passed through the doors and moved awkwardly to sit in one of the\nchairs along the wall. His secret felt so fragile within him that he could\nhardly believe it was still intact.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>I am not When he looked up, he\nfound Bannor standing before him. The Bloodguard's face was devoid of\nexpression, but it did not seem uncontemptuous. Its flat ambiguity appeared\ncapable of any response, and now it implied a judgment of Covenant's weakness,\nhis disease.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Impelled by anger and frustration,\nCovenant muttered to himself, Keep moving. Survive. &quot;Bannor,&quot; he\ngrowled, &quot;Mhoram seems to think we should get to know each other. He told\nme to ask you about the Bloodguard.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Bannor shrugged as if he were\nimpervious to any question.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Your people-the\nHaruchai&quot;-Bannor nodded &quot;live up in the mountains. You came to the\nLand when Kevin was High Lord. How long ago was that?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Centuries before the\nDesecration.&quot; The Bloodguard's alien tone seemed to suggest that units of\ntime like years and decades had no significance. &quot;Two thousand\nyears.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Two thousand years. Thinking of\nthe Giants, Covenant said, &quot;That's why there's only five hundred of you\nleft Since you came to the Land you've been dying off.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;The Bloodguard have always\nnumbered five hundred. That is the Vow. The Haruchai-are more.&quot; He gave\nthe name a tonal lilt that suited his voice.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;More?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;They live in the mountains\nas before.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Then how do you-You say that\nas if you haven't been back there for a long time.&quot; Again Bannor nodded\nslightly. &quot;How do you maintain your five hundred here? I haven't seen\nany-&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Bannor interrupted\ndispassionately. &quot;When one of the Bloodguard is slain, his body is sent\ninto the mountains through Guards Gap, and another of the Haruchai comes to\ntake his place in the Vow.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Is slain? Covenant wondered.\n&quot;Haven't you been come since? Don't you visit your- Do you have a</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;At one time.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Bannor's tone did not vary, but\nsomething in his inflectionlessness made Covenant feel that the question was\nimportant. &quot;At one time?&quot; he pursued. &quot;What happened to\nher?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;She has been dead.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>An instinct warned Covenant, but\nhe went on, spurred by the fascination of Bannor's alien, inflexible solidity.\n&quot;How how long ago did she die?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Without a flicker of hesitation,\nthe Bloodguard replied, &quot;Two thousand years.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>What! For a long moment, Covenant\ngaped in astonishment, whispering to himself as if he feared that Bannor could\nhear him, That's impossible. That's impossible. In an effort to control\nhimself, he blinked dumbly. Two-? What is this?</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Yet in spite of his amazement,\nBannor's claim carried conviction. That flat tone sounded incapable of\ndishonesty, of even misrepresentation. It filled Covenant with horror, with\nnauseated sympathy. In sudden vision he glimpsed the import of Mhoram's\ndescription, made by their pledged loyalty ascetic,</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>womanless, and old. Barren-how\ncould there be any limit to a barrenness which had already lasted for two\nthousand years? &quot;How,&quot; he croaked, &quot;how old are you?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;I came to the Land with the\nfirst Haruchai, when Kevin was young in High Lordship. Together we first\nuttered the Vow of service. Together we called upon the Earthpower to witness\nour commitment. Now we do not return home until we have been slain.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Two thousand years, Covenant\nmumbled. Until we have been slain. That's impossible. None of this is\nhappening. In his confusion, he tried to tell himself that what he heard was\nlike the sensitivity of his nerves, further proof of the Land's impossibility.\nBut it did not feel like proof. It moved him as if he had learned that Bannor\nsuffered from a rare form of leprosy. With an effort, he breathed,\n&quot;Why?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Flatly, Bannor said, &quot;When we\ncame to the Land, we saw wonders-Giants, Ranyhyn, RevelstoneLords of such power\nthat they declined to wage war with us lest we be destroyed. In answer to our\nchallenge, they gave to the Haruchai gifts so precious-&quot; He paused,\nappeared to muse for a moment over private memories. &quot;Therefore we swore\nthe Vow. We could not equal that generosity in any other way.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Is that your answer to\ndeath?&quot; Covenant struggled with his sympathy, tried to reduce what Bannor\nsaid to manageable proportions. &quot;Is that how things are done in the Land?\nWhenever you're in trouble you just do the impossible? Like Berek?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;We have sworn the Vow. The\nVow is life. Corruption is death.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;But for two thousand\nyears?&quot; Covenant protested. &quot;Damnation! It isn't even decent. Don't\nyou think you've done enough?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Without expression, the Bloodguard\nreplied, &quot;You cannot corrupt us.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Corrupt you? I don't want to\ncorrupt you. You can go on serving those Lords until you wither for all I care.\nI'm talking about your life, Bannor! How long do you go on serving without just\nonce asking yourself if it's worth it? Pride or at least sanity requires that.\nHellfire!&quot; He could trot conceive how even a healthy man remained\nunsuicidal in the face of so much existence. &quot;It isn't like salad\ndressing-you can't just spoon it around. You're human. You weren't born to be\nimmortal.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Bannor shrugged impassively.\n&quot;What does immortality signify? We are the Bloodguard. We know only life\nor death the Vow or Corruption.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>An instant passed before Covenant\nremembered that Corruption was the Bloodguard name for Lord Foul. &quot;Then he\ngroaned, &quot;Well of course I understand. You live forever because your pure,\nsinless service is utterly and indomitably unballasted by any weight or dross\nof mere human weakness. Ah, the advantages of clean Wig, &quot;We do not\nknow.&quot; Bannor's awkward tone echoed strangely &quot;Kevin saved us. How\ncould we guess what eras in his heart? He sent us all into the mountains into\nthe mountains. We questioned, but he gave the order. He charged us by our Vow.\nWe knew no mason to disobey. How could we know? We would have stood by him at\nthe Desecration-stood by or prevented. But he saved us-the Bloodguard. We who\nswore to preserve his life at any cost.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Saved, Covenant breathed\npainfully. He could feel the unintended cruelty of Kevin's act. &quot;So now\nyou don't know whether all these years of living are right or wrong,&quot; he\nsaid distantly. How do you stand it? &quot;Maybe your Vow is mocking you.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;There is no accusation which\ncan raise its finger against us,&quot; Bannor averred. But for an instant his\ndispassion sounded a shade less immaculate.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;No, you do all that\nyourself.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>In response, Bannor blinked\nslowly, as if neither blame nor exculpation carried meaning to the ancient\nperspective of his devotion.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>A moment later, one of the\nsentries beckoned Covenant toward the Close. Trepidation constricted his heart.\nHis horrified sympathy for Bannor drained his courage; he did not feel able to\nface the Lords, answer their demands. He climbed to his feet as if he were\ntottering, then hesitated. When Bannor motioned him forward, he said in a rush,\n&quot;Tell me one more thing. If your wife were still alive, would you go to\nvisit her and then come back here? Could you-&quot; He faltered. &quot;Could\nyou bear it?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The Bloodguard met his imploring\ngaze squarely, but thoughts seemed to pass like shadows behind his countenance\nbefore he said softly, &quot;No.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Breathing heavily as if he were\nnauseated, Covenant shambled through the door and down the steps toward the\nyellow immolation of the graveling pit.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Prothall, Mhoram, and Osondrea,\nFoamfollower, the four Bloodguard, the four spectators-all remained as he had\nleft them. Under the ominous expectancy of their eyes, he seated himself in the\nlone chair below the Lords' table. He was shivering as if the fire-stones\nradiated cold rather than heat.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>When the High Lord spoke, the age\nrattle in his voice seemed worse than before. &quot;Thomas Covenant, if we have\ntreated you wrongly we will beg your pardon at the proper time. But we must\nresolve our doubt of you. You have concealed much that we must know. However,\non one matter we have been able to agree. We see your presence in the Land in\nthis way.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;While delving under Mount\nThunder, Drool Rockworm found the lost Staff of Law. Without aid, he would\nrequire many years to master it. But Lord Foul the Despiser learned of Drool's\ndiscovery, and agreed for his own purposes to teach the Cavewight the uses of\nthe Staff. Clearly he did not wrest the Staff from Drool. Perhaps he was too\nweak. Or perhaps he feared to use a tool not made for his hand. Or perhaps he\nhas some terrible purpose which we do not grasp. But again it is clear that\nLord Foul induced Drool to use the Staff to summon you to the Land-only the\nStaff of Law has such might. And Drool could not have conceived or executed\nthat task without deep-lored aid. You were brought to the Land at Lord Foul's\nbehest. We can only pray that there were other powers at work as well.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;But that does not tell us\nwhy,&quot; said Mhoram intently. &quot;If the carrying of messages were Lord\nFoul's only purpose, he had no need of someone from beyond the Land-and no need\nto protect you from Drool, as he did when he bore you to Kevin's Watch, and as\nI believe he attempted to do by sending his Raver to turn you from your path\ntoward Andelain. No, you are our sole guide to the Despiser's true intent. Why\ndid he call someone from beyond the Land? And why you? In what way do you serve\nhis designs?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Panting, Covenant locked his jaws\nand said nothing.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Let me put the matter\nanother way,&quot; Prothall urged. &quot;The tale you have told us contains\nevidence of truth. Few living know that the Ravers were at one time named\nHerein, Sheol, and Jehannum. And we know that one of the Unfettered has been\nstudying the Wraiths of Andelain for many years.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Unwillingly, Covenant remembered\nthe hopeless courage of the animals that had helped the Unfettered One to save\nhim in Andelain. They had hurled themselves into their own slaughter with\ndesperate and futile ferocity. He gritted his teeth, tried to close his ears to\nthe memory of their dying.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Prothall went on without a pause,\n&quot;And we know that the lomillialor test of truth is sure-if the one tested\ndoes not surpass the tester.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;But the Despiser also\nknows,&quot; snapped Osondrea. &quot;He could know that an Unfettered One lived\nand studied in Andelain. He could have prepared this tale and taught it to you.\nIf he did,&quot; she enunciated darkly, &quot;then the matters on which you\nhave refused to speak are precisely those on which your story would fail. Why\ndid the Hirebrand of Soaring Woodhelven test you? How was the testing done? Who\nhave you battled with that staff? What instinct turned Atiaran Trell-mate\nagainst you? You fear to reply because then we will see the Despiser's\nhandiwork.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Authoritatively, High Lord Prothall\nrattled, &quot;Thomas Covenant, you must give us some token that your tale is\ntrue.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Token?&quot; Covenant\ngroaned.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Give us proof that we should\ntrust you. You have uttered a doom upon our lives. That we believe. But perhaps\nit is your purpose to lead us from the true defense of the Land. Give us some\ntoken, Unbeliever.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Through his quavering, Covenant\nfelt the impenetrable circumstance of his dream clamp shut on him,</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>deny every desire for hope or\nindependence. He climbed to his feet, strove to meet the crisis erect. As a</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>last resort, he grated to\nFoamfollower, &quot;Tell them. Atiaran blamed herself for what happened to the\nCelebration. Because she ignored the warnings. Tell them.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>He burned at Foamfollower, willing\nthe Giant to support his last chance for autonomy, and after a grave moment the\nGiant said, &quot;My friend Thomas Covenant speaks truth, in his way. Atiaran\nTrell-mate believed the worst of herself.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Nevertheless!&quot; Osondrea\nsnapped. &quot;Perhaps she blamed herself for guiding him to the Celebration\nfor enabling- Her pain does not approve him.&quot; And Prothall insisted in a\nlow voice, &quot;Your token, Covenant. The necessity for judgment is upon us.\nYou must choose between the Land and the Land's Despiser.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant, help them!</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;No!&quot; he gasped\nhoarsely, whirling to face the High Lord. &quot;It wasn't my fault. Don't you\nsee that this is just what Foul wants you to do?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Prothall stood, braced his weight\non his staff. His stature seemed to expand in power as he spoke. &quot;No,</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>I do not see. You are closed to\nme. You ask to be trusted, but you refuse to show trustworthiness. No. I demand\nthe token by which you refuse us. I am Prothall son of Dwillian, High Lord by\nthe choice of the Council. I demand.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>For one long instant, Covenant\nremained suspended in decision. His eyes fell to the graveling pit. Covenant,\nhelp them! With a groan, he remembered how much Atiaran had paid to place him\nwhere he stood now. Her pain does not approve. In counterpoint he heard Bannor\nsaying, Two thousand years. Life or death. We do not know. But the face he saw\nin the fire-stones was his wife's. Joan! he cried. Was one sick body more\nimportant than everything?</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>He tore open his shirt as if he\nwere trying to bare his heart. From the patch of clingor on his chest, be\nsnatched his wedding band, jammed it onto his ring finger, raised his left fist\nlike a defiance. But he was not defiant. &quot;I can't use it!&quot; he shouted\nlornly, as if the ring were still a symbol of marriage, not a talisman of wild\nmagic. &quot;I'm a leper!&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Astonishment rang in the Close,\nclanging changes m the air. The Hearthralls and Garth were stunned. Prothall\nshook his head as if he were trying to wake up for the first time in his life.\nIntuitive comprehension broke like a bow wave on Mhoram's face, and he mapped\nto his feet in stiff attention. Grinning gratefully, Foamfollower stood as\nwell. Lord Osondrea also joined Mhoram, but there was no relief in her eyes.\nCovenant could see her shouldering her way through a throng of confusions to\nthe crux of the situation- Could see her thinking, Save or damn, save or damn.\nShe alone among the Lords appeared to realize that teen this token did not\nsuffice.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Finally the High Lord mastered\nhimself. &quot;Now at list we know how to honor you,&quot; he breathed.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Ur-Lord Thomas Covenant,\nUnbeliever and white gold Wider, be welcome and true. Forgive us, for we did\nnot know. Yours is the wild magic that destroys peace. And power is at all\ntimes a dreadful thing.&quot; The Lords saluted Covenant as if they wished to\nboth invoke and ward against him, then together began to sing:</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>There is wild magic graven in\nevery rock, contained for white gold to unleash or control gold, rare metal,\nnot born of the Land, nor ruled, limited, subdued by the Law with which the\nLand was created (for the Land is beautiful, as if it were a strong soul's dream\nof peace and harmony, and Beauty is not possible without discipline and the Law\nwhich gave birth to Time is the Land's Creator's self-control)but keystone\nrather, pivot, crux for the anarchy out of which Time was made, and with Time\nEarth, and with</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Earth those who people it: wild\nmagic restrained in every particle of life, and unleashed or controlled by gold\n(not born of the Land) because that power is the anchor of the arch of life\nthat spans and masters Time: and white-white gold, not ebon, ichor, incarnadine,\nviridian because white is the hue of bone: structure of flesh, discipline of\nlife.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>This power is a paradox, because\nPower does not exist without Law, and wild magic has no Law; and white gold is\na paradox, because it speaks for the bone of life, but has no part of the Land.\nAnd he who wields white wild magic gold is a paradox for he is everything and\nnothing, hero and fool, potent, helpless and with the one word of truth or\ntreachery he will save or damn the Earth because he is mad and sane, cold and\npassionate, lost and found.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>It was an involuted song,\ncuriously harmonized, with no resolving cadences to set the hearers at rest.\nAnd in it Covenant could hear the vulture wings of Foul's voice saying, You\nhave might, but you will never know what it is. You will not be able to fight\nme at the last. As the song ended, he wondered if his struggling served or\ndefied the Despiser's manipulations. He could not tell. But he hated and feared\nthe truth in Foul's words. He cut into the silence which followed the Lords'\nhymning. &quot;I don't know how to use it. I don't want to know. That's not why\nI wear it. If you think I'm some kind of personified redemption-it's a lie. I'm\na leper.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Ah, ur-Lord Covenant,&quot;\nProthall sighed as the Lords and Foamfollower reseated themselves, &quot;let me\nsay again, please forgive us. We understand much now -why you were summoned-\nwhy the Hirebrand Baradakas treated you as he did-why Drool Rockworm attempted\nto ensnare you at the Celebration of Spring. Please understand in turn that\nknowledge of the ring is necessary to us. Your semblance to Berek Halfhand is\nnot gratuitous. But, sadly, we cannot tell you how to use the white gold. Alas,\nwe know little enough of the Lore we already possess. And I fear that if we\nheld and comprehended all Seven Wards and Words, the wild magic would still be\nbeyond us. Knowledge of white gold has come down ID us through the ancient\nprophecies-foretellings, as Saltheart Foamfollower has observed, which say much\nbet clarify little-but we comprehend nothing of the wild magic. Still, the\nprophecies are clear about your importance. So I name you `ur-Lord,' a sharer\nof all the matters of the Council until you depart from us. We must trust\nyou.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Pacing back and forth now on the\nspur of his conflicting needs, Covenant growled, &quot;Baradakas said just\nabout the same thing. By hell! You people terrify me. When I try to be\nresponsible, you pressure me-and when I collapse you You're not asking the\nright questions. You don't have the vaguest notion of what a leper is, and it\ndoesn't even occur to you to inquire. That's why Foul chose me for this.\nBecause I can't- Damnation! Why don't you ask me about where I come from? I've\ngot to tell you. The world I come from doesn't allow anyone to live except on\nits own terms. Those terms-those terms contradict yours.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;What are its terms?&quot;\nthe High Lord asked carefully. &quot;That your world is a dream.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>In the startled stillness of the\nClose, Covenant grimaced, winced as images flashed at him-courthouse columns,\nan old beggar, the muzzle of the police car. A dream! he panted feverishly. A\ndream! None of this is happening-!</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Then Osondrea shot out,\n&quot;What? A dream? Do you mean to say that you are dreaming? Do you believe\nthat you are asleep?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Yes!&quot; He felt weak with\nfear; his revelation bereft him of a shield, exposed him to attack. But he\ncould not recant it. He needed it to regain some kind of honesty.\n&quot;Yes.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Indeed!&quot; she snapped.\n&quot;No doubt that explains the slaughter of the Celebration. Tell me,\nUnbeliever -do you consider that a nightmare, or does your world relish such\ndreams?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Before Covenant could retort, Lord\nMhoram said, &quot;Enough, sister Osondrea. He torments himself\nsufficently.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Glaring, she fell silent, and\nafter a moment Prothall said, &quot;It may be that gods have such dreams as\nthis. But we are mortals. We can only resist ill or surrender. Either way, we\nperish. Were you sent to mock 3 us for this?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Mock you?&quot; Covenant\ncould not find the words to respond. He chopped dumbly at the thought with his\nhalfhand. &quot;It's the other way around. He's mocking me.&quot; When all the\nLords looked at him in incomprehension, he cried abruptly, &quot;I can feel the\npulse in my fingertips! But that's impossible. I've got a disease. An incurable\ndisease. I've-I've got to figure out a way to keep from going crazy. Hell and\nblood! I don't want to lose my mind just because some perfectly decent\ncharacter in a dream needs something from me that I can't produce.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Well, that may be.&quot;\nProthall's voice held a note of sadness and sympathy, as if he were listening\nto some abrogation or repudiation of sanity from a revered seer. &quot;But we\nwill trust you nonetheless. You are bitter, and bitterness is a sign of\nconcern. I trust that. And what you say also meets the old prophecy. I fear the\ntime is coming when you will be the Land's last hope.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Don't you understand?&quot;\nCovenant groaned, unable to silence the ache in his voice. &quot;That's what\nFoul wants you to think.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Perhaps,&quot; Mhoram said\nthoughtfully. &quot;Perhaps.&quot; Then, as if he had reached a decision, he\nturned the peril of his gaze straight at Covenant. &quot;Unbeliever, I must ask\nyou if you have resisted Lord Foul. I do not speak of the Celebration. When he\nbore you from Drool Rockworm to Kevin's Watch-did you oppose him?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The question made Covenant feel\nabruptly frail, as if it had snapped a cord of his resistance. &quot;I didn't\nknow how.&quot; Wearily, he reseated himself in the loneliness of his chair.\n&quot;I didn't know what was happening.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;You are ur-Lord now,&quot;\nmurmured Mhoram. &quot;There is no more need for you to sit there.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;No need to sit at all,&quot;\namended Prothall, with sadden briskness. &quot;There is much work to be done.\nWe must think and probe and plan-whatever action we will take in this trial\nmust be chosen quickly. We will meet again tonight. Tuvor, Garth, Birinair,\nTohrm -prepare yourselves and those in your command. Bring whatever thoughts of\nstrategy you have to the Council tonight. And tell all the Keep that Thomas\nCovenant has been named ur-Lord. He is a stranger and a guest. Birinair-begin\nyour work for the Giants at once. Bannor, I think the ur-Lord need no longer\nstay in the tower.&quot; He paused and looked about him, giving everyone a\nchance to speak. Then he turned and left the Close. Osondrea followed him, and\nafter giving Covenant another formal salute, Mhoram also departed.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Numbly, Covenant moved behind\nBannor up through the high passages and stairways until they reached his new\nquarters. The Bloodguard ushered him into a suite of rooms. They were\nhigh-ceilinged, lit by reflected sunlight through several broad windows,\nabundantly supplied with food and springwine, and unadorned. When Bannor had\nleft, Covenant looked out one of the windows, and found that his rooms were\nperched in the north wall of Revelstone, with a view of the rough plains and\nthe northwardcurving</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>cliff of the plateau. The sun was\noverhead, but a bit south of the Keep, so that the windows were in shadow.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>He left the window, moved to the\ntray of food, and ate a light meal. Then he poured out a flask of springwine,\nwhich he carried into the bedroom. There he found one orieled window. It had an\nair of privacy, of peace.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Where did he go from here? He did\nnot need to be self-wise or prophetic to know that he could not remain in\nRevelstone. He was too vulnerable here.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>He sat down in the stone alcove to\nbrood over the Land below and wonder what he had done to himself.<br clear=all\nstyle='page-break-before:always'>\n</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><a name=\"_Toc370739020\"><span class=Heading1Char><span\nstyle='font-size:16.0pt;line-height:105%'>FIFTEEN: The Great Challenge</span></span></a></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>That night, when Bannor entered\nthe suite to call Thomas Covenant to the evening meeting of the Lords, he found\nCovenant still sitting within the oriel of his bedroom window. By the light of Bannor's\ntorch, Covenant appeared gaunt and spectral, as if half seen through shadows.\nThe sockets of his eyes were dark with exhausted emotion; his lips were gray,\nbloodless; and the skin of his forehead had an ashen undertone. He held his\narms across his chest as if he were trying to comfort a pain in his\nheartwatched the plains as if he were waiting for moonrise. Then he noticed the\nBloodguard, and his lips pulled back, bared his teeth.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;You still don't trust\nme,&quot; he said in a spent voice.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Bannor shrugged. &quot;We are the\nBloodguard. We have no use for white gold.&quot; &quot;No use?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;It is a knowledge-a weapon.\nWe have no use for weapons.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;No use?&quot; Covenant\nrepeated dully. &quot;How do you defend the Lords without weapons?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;We&quot;-Bannor paused as if\nsearching the language of the Land for a word to match his\nthought-&quot;suffice.&quot; Covenant brooded for a moment, then swung himself\nout of the oriel. Standing in front of Bannor, he said softly,\n&quot;Bravo.&quot; Then he picked up his staff and kit the rooms.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>This time, he paid more attention\nto the route Bannor chose, and did not lose his sense of direction. Eventually,\nhe might be able to dispense with Bannor's guidance. When they reached the huge\nwooden doors of the Close, they met Foamfollower and Korik. The Giant greeted\nCovenant with a salute and a broad grin, but when he spoke his voice was\nserious. &quot;Stone and Sea, ur-Lord Covenant! I am glad you did not choose to\nmake me wrong. Perhaps I do not comprehend all your dilemma. But I believe you\nhave taken the better risk-for the sake of all the Land.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;You're a fine one to\ntalk,&quot; replied Covenant wanly. His sarcasm was a defensive reflex; he had\nlost so much other armor. &quot;How long have you Giants been lost? I don't\nthink you would know a good risk if it kicked you.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Foamfollower chuckled. &quot;Bravely\nsaid, my friend. It may be that the Giants are not good advisers-all our years\nnotwithstanding. Still you have lightened my fear for the Land.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Grimacing uselessly, Covenant went\non into the Close.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The council chamber was as\nbrightly lit and acoustically perfect as before, but the number of people in it\nhad changed. Tamarantha and Variol were absent, and scattered through the\ngallery were a number of spectators rhadhamaerl, lillianrill, warriors,\nLorewardens. Bloodguard sat behind Mhoram and Osondrea;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>and Tuvor, Garth, Birinair, and\nTohrm were in their places behind the High Lord.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Foamfollower took his former seat,\ngesturing Covenant into a chair near him at the Lords' table. Behind them,\nBannor and Korik sat down in the lower tier of the gallery. The spectators fell\nsilent almost at once; even the rustle of their clothing grew still. Shortly,\neveryone was waiting for the High Lord to begin.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Prothall sat as if wandering in\nthought for some time before he climbed tiredly to his feet. He held himself up\nby leaning on his staff, and when he spoke his voice rattled agedly in his\nchest. But he went without omission through the ceremonies of honoring\nFoamfollower and Covenant. The Giant responded with a gaiety which disguised\nthe effort he made to be concise. But Covenant rejected the formality with a\nscowl and a shake of his head.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>When he was done, Prothall said\nwithout meeting the eyes of his fellow Lords, &quot;There is a custom among the\nnew Lords-a custom which began in the days of High Lord Vailant, a hundred\nyears ago. It is this: when a High Lord doubts his ability to meet the needs of\nthe Land, he may come to the Council and surrender his High Lordship. Then any\nLord who so chooses may claim the place for himself.&quot; With an effort,\nProthall continued firmly, &quot;I now surrender my leadership. Rock and root,\nthe trial of these times is too great for me. Ur-Lord Thomas Covenant, you are\npermitted to claim the High Lordship if you wish.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant held Prothall's eyes,\ntrying to measure the High Lord's intentions. But he could find no duplicity in\nProthall's offer. Softly, he replied, &quot;You know I don't want it.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Yet I ask you to accept it.\nYou bear the white gold.&quot; &quot;Forget it,&quot; Covenant said. &quot;It\nisn't that easy.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>After a moment, Prothall nodded\nslowly. &quot;I see.&quot; He turned to the other Lords. &quot;Do you claim the\nHigh Lordship?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;You are the High Lord,&quot;\nMhoram averred. And Osondrea added, &quot;Who else? Do not waste more time in\nfoolishness.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Very well.&quot; Prothall\nsquared his shoulders. &quot;The trial and the doom of this time are on my\nhead. I am High Lord Prothall, and by the consent of the Council my will\nprevails. Let none fear to follow me, or blame mother if my choices fail.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>An involuntary twitch passed\nacross Covenant's face, but he said nothing; and shortly Prothall sat sown,\nsaying, &quot;Now let us consider what we must do.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>In silence the Lords communed\nmentally with each other. Then Osondrea turned to Foamfollower.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>'Rockbrother, it is said, `When\nmany matters press you, consider friendship first.' For the sake of your people\nyou should return to Seareach as swiftly as may be. The Giants must be told all\nthat has transpired here. But I judge that the waterway of Andelain will no\nlonger be safe for you. We will provide an escort to accompany you through\nGrimmerdhore Forest and the North Plains until you are past Landsdrop and\nSarangrave Flat.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Thank you, my Lords,&quot;\nreplied Foamfollower formally, &quot;but that will not be needed. I have given\nsome thought myself to this matter. In their wandering, my people learned a\nsaying from the Bhrathair: `He who waits for the sword to fall upon his neck\nwill surely lose his head.' I believe that the best service which I can do for\nmy people is to assist whatever course you undertake. Please permit me to join\nyou.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>High Lord Prothall smiled and\nbowed his head in acknowledgement. &quot;My heart hoped for this. Be welcome in\nour trial. Peril or plight, the Giants of Seareach strengthen us, and we cannot\nsing our gratitude enough. But your people must not be left unwarned. We will\nsend other messengers.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Foamfollower bowed in turn, and\nthen Lord Osondrea resumed by calling on Warmark Garth.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Garth stood and reported,\n&quot;Lord, I have done as you requested. Furls Fire now burns atop Revelstone.\nAll who see it will warn their folk, and will spread the warning of war south\nand east and north. By morning, all who live north of the Soulsease and west of\nGrimmerdhore will be forearmed, and those who live near the river will send\nrunners into the Center Plains. Beyond that, the warning will carry more\nslowly.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;I have sent scouts in relays\ntoward Grimmerdhore and Andelain. But six days will pass before we receive\nclear word of the Forest. And though you did not request it, I have begun\npreparations for a siege. In all, one thousand three hundred of my warriors are\nnow at work. Twenty Eoman remain ready.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;That is well,&quot; said\nOsondrea. &quot;The warning which must be taken to Seareach we entrust to you.\nSend as many warriors as you deem necessary to ensure the embassy.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Garth bowed and sat down.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Now.&quot; She nodded her\nhead as if to clear it of other considerations. &quot;I have given my time to\nthe study of ur-Lord Covenant's tale of his journey. The presence of white gold\nexplains much. But still many things require thought-southrunning storms, a\nthreewinged bird, an abominable attack on the Wraiths of Andelain, the\nbloodying of the moon. To my mind, the meaning of these signs is clear.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Abruptly, she slapped the table\nwith her palm as if she needed the sound and the pain to help her I speak.\n&quot;Drool Rockworm has already found his bane -the Illearth Stone or some\nother deadly evil. With the Staff of Law, he has might enough to blast the\nseasons in their course!&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>A low groan arose from the\ngallery, but Prothall and Mhoram did not appear surprised. Still, a dangerous\nglitter intensified in Mhoram's eyes as he said softly, &quot;Please\nexplain.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;The evidence of power is\nunmistakable. We know that Drool has the Staff of Law. But the Staff is not a\nneutral tool. It was carved from the One Tree as a servant of the Earth and the\nEarth's Law. Yet all tha has occurred is unnatural, wrong. Can you conceive the\nstrength of will which could corrupt the Staff even enough to warp one bird?\nWell, perhaps madness gives Drool that will. Or perhaps the Despiser now\ncontrols the Staff. But consider-birthing a three-winged bird is the smallest\nof these ill feats. At his</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>peak in the former age, Lord Foul\ndid not dare attack the Wraiths. And as for the desecrated noon-only the\ndarkest and most terrible of ancient prophecies bespeak such matters.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Do you call this proof\nconclusive that Lord Foul indeed possesses the Staff? But consider-for less\nexertion than corrupting the moon requires, he could surely stamp us into\ndeath. We could not fight such night. And yet he spends himself so-so vainly.\nWould he employ his strength to so little purpose- attainst the Wraiths first\nwhen he could easily destroy us? And if he would, could he corrupt the moon\nusing the Staff of Law-a tool not made for his hand, resisting his mastery at\nevery touch?</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;I judge that if Lord Foul controlled\nthe Staff, he would not and perhaps could not do what has been done-not until\nwe were destroyed. But if Drool still holds the Staff, then it alone does not\nsuffice. No Cavewight is large enough to perform such crimes without the power\nof both Staff and Stone. The Cavewights are weak-willed creatures, as you know.\nThey are easily swayed, easily enslaved. And they have no heaven-challenging\nlore. Therefore they have always been the fodder of Lord Foul's armies.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;If I judge truly, then the\nDespiser himself is as much at Drool's mercy as we are. The doom of this time\nrides on the mad whim of a Cavewight.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;This I conclude because we\nhave not been attacked.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Prothall nodded glumly to\nOsondrea, and Mhoram took up the line of her reasoning. &quot;So Lord Foul relies\nupon us to save him and damn ourselves. In some way, he intends that our\nresponse to ur-Lord Covenant's message will spring upon ourselves a trap which\nholds both us and him. He has pretended friendship to Drool to preserve himself\nuntil his plans are ripe. And he has taught Drool to use this newfound power in\nways which will satisfy the Cavewight's lust for mastery without threatening us\ndirectly. Thus he attempts to ensure that we will make trial to wrest the Staff\nof Law from Drool.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;And therefore,&quot;\nOsondrea barked, &quot;it would be the utterest folly for us to make\ntrial.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;How so?&quot; Mhoram\nobjected. &quot;The message said, `Without it, they will not be able to resist\nme for seven years.' He foretells a sooner end for us if we do not make the\nattempt, or if we attempt and fail, than if we succeed.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;What does he gain by such\nforetellings? What but our immediate deaths? His message is only a lure of\nfalse hope to lead us into folly.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>But Mhoram replied by quoting,\n&quot; `Drool Rockworm has the Staff, and that is a cause for terror. He will\nbe enthroned at Lord's Keep in two years if the message fails.' &quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;The message has not\nfailed!&quot; Osondrea insisted. &quot;We are forewarned. We can prepare. Drool\nis mad, and his attacks will be flawed by madness. It may be that we will find\nhis weakness and prevail. By the Seven! Revelstone will never fall while the\nBloodguard remain. And the Giants and Ranyhyn will come to our aid.&quot;\nTurning toward the High Lord, she urged, &quot;Prothall, do not follow the lure\nof this quest. It is chimera. We will fall under the shadow, and the Land will\nsurely die.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;But if we succeed,&quot;\nMhoram countered, &quot;if we gain the Staff, then our chance is prolonged.\nLord Foul's prophecy notwithstanding, we may find enough Earthpower in the\nStaff to prevail in war. And if we do not, still we will have that much more\ntime to search for other salvations.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;How can we succeed? Drool\nhas both the Staff of Law and the Illearth Stone.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;And is master of\nneither.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Master enough! Ask the\nWraiths the extent of his might. Ask the moon.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Ask me,&quot; growled\nCovenant, climbing slowly to his feet. For a moment he hesitated, torn between\na fear of Drool and a dread of what would happen to him if the Lords did not go\nin search of the Staff. H had a vivid apprehension of the malice behind Drool's\nLaval eyes. But the thought of the Staff decided him. He felt that he had\ngained an insight into the logic of his dream. The Staff had brought him to the\nLand; he would need the Staff to escape. &quot;Ask me,&quot; he said again.\n&quot;Don't you think I have a stake in this?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The Lords did not respond, and\nCovenant was forced to carry the argument forward himself. In his brooding, he\nhad been able to find only one frail hope. With an effort, he broached the\nsubject.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;According to you, Foul chose\nme. But he talked about me on Kevin's Watch as if I had been chosen by someone\nelse-`my Enemy,' he said. Who was he talking about?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Thoughtfully, the High Lord\n.replied, &quot;I do not know. We said earlier that we hoped there were other\nforces at work in your selection. Perhaps there were. A few of our oldest\nlegends speak of a Creator -the Creator of the Earth-but we know nothing of\nsuch a being. We only know that we are mortal, but Lord Foul is not-in some\nway, he surpasses flesh.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;The Creator,&quot; Covenant\nmuttered. &quot;All right.&quot; A disturbing memory of the old beggar who had\naccosted him outside the courthouse flared momentarily. &quot;Why did he choose\nme?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Prothall's abnegate eyes did not\nwaver. &quot;Who can say? Perhaps for the very reasons that Lord Foul chooses\nyou.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>That paradox angered Covenant, but\nhe went on as if inspired by the contradiction, &quot;Then this Creator-also\nwanted you to hear Foul's message. Take that into account.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;There!&quot; Osondrea\npounced. &quot;There is the lie I sought-the final bait. By raising the hope of\nunknown help, Lord Foul seeks to ensure that we will accept this mad\nquest.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant did not look away from\nthe High Lord. He held Prothall's eyes, tried to see beyond the wear of long\nasceticisms into his mind. But Prothall returned the gaze unflinchingly. The lines\nat the corners of his eyes seemed etched there by self-abrogation. &quot;Lord\nOsondrea,&quot; he said evenly, &quot;does your study reveal any signs of\nhope?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Signs? Omens?&quot; Her\nvoice sounded reluctant in the Close. &quot;I am not Mhoram. If I were, I would\nask Covenant what dreams he has had in the Land. But I prefer practical hopes.\nI see but one: so little time has been lost. It is in my heart that no other\ncombination of chance and choice could have brought Covenant here so\nswiftly.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Very well,&quot; Prothall\nreplied. His look, locked with Covenant's, sharpened momentarily, and in it\nCovenant at last saw that the High Lord had already made his decision. He only\nlistened to the debate to give himself one last chance to find an alternative.\nAwkwardly, Covenant dropped his eyes, slumped in his chair. How does he do it?\nhe murmured point lessly to himself. Where does all this courage come from?</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Am I the only coward-?</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>A moment later, the High Lord\npulled his blue robe about him and rose to his feet. &quot;My friends,&quot; he\nsaid, his voice thick with rheum, &quot;the time has come for decision. I must\nchoose a course to meet our need. If any have thoughts which must be uttered,\nspeak now.&quot; No one spoke, and Prothall seemed to draw dignity and stature\nfrom the silence. &quot;Hear then the will of Prothall son of Dwillian, High\nLord by the choice of the Council-and may the Land forgive me if I mistake or\nfail. In this moment, I commit the future of the Earth.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Lord Osondrea, to you and to\nthe Lords Variol and Tamarantha I entrust the defenses of the Land. I charge\nyou-do all which wisdom or vision suggest to preserve the life in our sworn\ncare. Remember that there is always hope while Revelstone stands. But if\nRevelstone falls, then all the ages and works of the Lords, from Berek\nHeartthew to our generation, shall come to an end, and the Land will never know\nthe like again.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Lord Mhoram and I will go in\nsearch of Drool Rockworm and the Staff of Law. With us will go the Giant\nSaltheart Foamfollower, ur-Lord Thomas Covenant, as many of the Bloodguard as\nFirst Mark Tuvor deems proper to spare from the defense of Revelstone, and one\nEoman of the Warward. Thus we will not go blithe or unguarded into doom-but the\nmain might of Lord's Keep will be left for the defense of the Land if we fail.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Hear and be ready. The Quest\ndeparts at first fight.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;High Lord!&quot; protested\nGarth, leaping to his feet. 'Will you not wait for some word from my scouts?</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>You must brave Grimmerdhore to\npass toward Mount Thunder If the Forest is infested by the servants of Drool or\nthe Gray Slayer, you will have little safety until my scouts have found out the\nmovements of the enemy.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;That is true, Warmark,&quot;\nsaid Prothall. &quot;But how long will we be delayed?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Six days, High Lord. Then we\nwill know how much force the crossing of Grimmerdhore requires.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>For some time, Mhoram had been\nsitting with his chin in his hands, staring absently into the graveling pit.\nBut now he roused himself and said, &quot;One hundred Bloodguard. Or every\nwarrior that Revelstone can provide. I have seen it. There are ur-viles in\nGrimmerdhore-and wolves by the thousands. They hunt in my dreams.&quot; His\nvoice seemed to chill the air in the Close like a wind of loss.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>But Prothall spoke at once,\nresisting the spell of Mhoram's words. &quot;No, Garth. We cannot delay. And\nthe peril of Grimmerdhore is too great. Even Drool Rockworm must understand\nthat our best road to Mount Thunder leads through the Forest and along the\nnorth of Andelain. No, we will go south-around Andelain, then east through\nMorinmoss to the Plains of Ra, before moving north to Gravin Threndor. I\nknow-that seems a long way, full of needless leagues, for a Quest which must\nrue the loss of each day. But this southward way will enable us to gain the\nhelp of the Ramen. Thus all the Despiser's olden foes will share in our Quest.\nAnd perhaps we will throw Drool out of his reckoning.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;No, my choice is clear. The\nQuest will depart tomorrow, riding south. That is my word. Let any who doubt\nspeak now.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>And- Thomas Covenant, who doubted\neverything, felt Prothall's resolution and dignity so strongly that he said\nnothing.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Then Mhoram and Osondrea stood,\nfollowed immediately by Foamfollower; and behind them the assembly rushed to\nits feet. All turned toward High Lord Prothall, and Osondrea lifted up her\nvoice to</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>say, &quot;Melenkurion Skyweir\nwatch over you, High Lord. Melenkurion abatha! Preserve and prevail! Seed and\nrock, may your purpose flourish. Let no evil blind or ill assail-no fear or\nfaint, no rest or joy or pain, assuage the grief of wrong. Cowardice is\ninexculpate, corruption unassoiled. Skyweir watch and Earthroot anneal.\nMelenkurion abatha! Minas mill khabaal!&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Prothall bowed his head, and the\ngallery and the Lords responded with one unanimous salute, one extending of\narms in mute benediction.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Then in slow order the people began\nto leave the Close. At the same time, Prothall, Mhoram, and Osondrea departed\nthrough their private doors.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Once the Lords were gone,\nFoamfollower joined Covenant, and they moved together up the steps, followed by\nBannor and Korik. Outside the Close, Foamfollower hesitated, considering\nsomething, then said, &quot;My friend, will you answer a question for me?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;You think I've got something\nleft to hide?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;As to that, who knows? The\nfaery Elohim had a saying-`The heart cherishes secrets not worth the telling.'\nAh, they were a laughing people. But --' &quot;No,&quot; Covenant cut in.\n&quot;I've been scrutinized enough.&quot; He started away toward his rooms.\n&quot;But you have not heard my question.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>He turned. &quot;Why should I? You\nwere going to ask what Atiaran had against me.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;No, my friend,&quot; replied\nFoamfollower, laughing softly. &quot;Let your heart cherish that secret to the\nend of time. My question is this. What dreams have you had since you came to\nthe Land? What did you dream that night in my boat?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Impulsively, Covenant answered,\n&quot;A crowd of my people-real people-were spitting blood at me. And one of\nthem said, `There is only one good answer to death.' &quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Only one? What answer is\nthat?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Turn your back on it,&quot;\nCovenant snapped as he strode away down the corridor. &quot;Outcast it.&quot;\nFoamFollower's good natured humor echoed in his ears, but he marched on until\nhe could no longer hear the Giant. Then he tried to remember the way to his\nrooms. With some help from Bannor, he found his suite and shut himself in, only\nbothering to light me torch before closing the door on the Bloodguard.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>He found that in his absence\nsomeone had shuttered his windows against the fell light of the moon.\nPerversely, he yanked one of them open. But the bloodscape hurt his eyes like\nthe stink of a corpse, and he slammed the shutter closed again. Then for a long\ntime before he went to bed he paced the floor, arguing with himself until\nfatigue overcame him.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>When morning neared, and Bannor\nbegan shaking him awake, he resisted. He wanted to go on sleeping as if in\nslumber he could find absolution. Dimly, he remembered that he was about to\nstart on a journey far more dangerous than the one he had just completed, and\nhis tired consciousness moaned in protest.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Come,&quot; said Bannor.\n&quot;If we delay, we will miss the call of the Ranyhyn.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Go to hell,&quot; Covenant\nmumbled. &quot;Don't you ever sleep?&quot; &quot;The Bloodguard do not\nsleep:&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;What?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;No Bloodguard has slept\nsince the Haruchai swore their Vow.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>With an effort, Covenant pulled\nhimself into a sitting position. He peered blearily at Bannor for a moment,\nthen muttered, &quot;You're already in hell.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The alien flatness of Bannor's\nvoice did not waver as he replied, &quot;You have no reason to mock us.&quot;\n&quot;Of course not,&quot; Covenant growled, climbing out of bed.\n&quot;Naturally, I'm supposed to enjoy having my integrity judged by someone\nwho doesn't even need sleep.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;We do not judge. We are\ncautious. The Lords are in our care.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Like Kevin-who killed\nhimself. And took just about everything else with him.&quot; But as he made\nthis retort, he felt suddenly ashamed of himself. In the firelight, he\nremembered the costliness of the Bloodguard's fidelity. Wincing at the coldness\nof the stone floor, he said, &quot;Forget it. I talk like that in self defense.\nRidicule seems to be-my only answer.&quot; Then he hurried away to wash, shave,\nand get dressed. After a quick meal, he made sure of his knife and staff, and\nat last nodded his readiness to the Bloodguard.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Bannor led him down to the\ncourtyard of the old Gilden tree. A haze of night still dimmed the air, but the\nstars were gone, and sunrise was clearly imminent. Unexpectedly, he felt that\nhe was taking part in something larger than himself. The sensation was an odd\none, and he tried to reason it away as he followed Bannor through the tunnel,\nbetween the huge, knuckled tower gates, and out into the dawn.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>There, near the wall a short\ndistance to the right of the gate, was gathered the company of the Quest. The\nwarriors of the Third Eoman sat astride their horses in a semicircle behind\nWarhaft Quaan, and to their left stood nine Bloodguard led by First Mark Tuvor.\nWithin the semicircle were Prothall, Mhoram,</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>and Saltheart Foamfollower. The\nGiant carried in his belt a quarterstaff as tall as a man, and wore a blue\nneckscarf that fluttered ebulliently in the morning breeze. Nearby were three\nmen holding three horses saddled in clingor. Above them all, the face of\nRevelstone was crowded with people. The dwellers of the mountain city thronged\nevery balcony and terrace, every window. And facing the gathered company was\nLord Osondrea. She held her head high as if she defied her responsibility to\nmake her stoop.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Then the sun crested the eastern\nhorizon. It caught the upper rim of the plateau, where burned the blue Same of\nwarning; it moved down the wall until it lifted High Lord's Furl out of the\ngloaming like the lighting of a torch. Next it revealed the red pennant, and\nthen a new white flag.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Nodding up at the new flag, Bannor\nsaid, &quot;That is for you, ur-Lord. The sign of white gold.&quot; Then he\nwest to take his place among the Bloodguard.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Silence rested on the company\nuntil the sunlight touched the ground, casting its gold glow over the Questers.\nAs soon as the light reached her feet, Osondrea began speaking as if she had\nbeen waiting patiently for this moment, and she covered the ache in her heart\nwith a scolding tone. &quot;I am in no mood tae the ceremony, Prothall. Call\nthe Ranyhyn, and go.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The folly of this undertaking will\nnot be made less by delay and brave words. There is nothing more for you to\nsay. I am well suited for my task, and the defense of the Land will not falter\nwhile I live. Go-call the Ranyhyn.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Prothall smiled gently, and Mhoram\nsaid with a grin, &quot;We are fortunate in you, Osondrea. I could not entrust\nany other with Variol my father and Tamarantha my mother.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Taunt me at your\nperil!&quot; she snapped. &quot;I am in no mood-no mood, do you hear?&quot;\n&quot;I hear. You know that I do not taunt you. Sister Osondrea, be\ncareful.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;I am always careful. Now go,\nbefore I lose patience altogether.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Prothall nodded to Tuvor; the ten\nBloodguard turned and spread out, so that each faced into the rising sun with\nno one to obscure his view. One at a time, each Bloodguard raised a hand to his\nmouth and gave a piercing whistle which echoed off the wall of the Keep into\nthe dawn air.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>They whistled again, and then a\nthird time, and each call sounded as fierce and lonely as a heart cry. But the\nlast whistle was answered by a distant whinny and a low thunder of mighty\nhooves. All eyes turned expectantly eastward, squinted into the morning glory.\nFor a long moment, nothing appeared, and the rumble of the earth came\ndisembodied to the company, a mystic manifestation. But then the horses could\nbe seen within the sun's orb, as if they had materialized in skyfire.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Soon the Ranyhyn passed out of the\ndirect line of the sun. There were ten of them-wild and challenging animals.\nThey were great craggy beasts, deepchested, proud-necked, with some of the\ndelicacy of pure-blooded stock and some of the rough angularity of mustangs.\nThey had long flying manes and tails, gaits as straight as plumb lines, eyes\nfull of restless intelligence. Chestnuts, bays, roans, they galloped toward the\nBloodguard.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant knew enough about horses\nto see that the Ranyhyn were as . individual as people, but they shared one\ntrait: a white star marked the center of each forehead. As they approached,\nwith the dawn burning on their backs, they looked like the Land personified-the\nessence of health and power.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Nickering and tossing their heads,\nthey halted before the Bloodguard. And the Bloodguard bowed deeply to them. The\nRanyhyn stamped their feet and shook their manes as if they were laughing\naffectionately at a mere human show of respect. After a moment Tuvor spoke to\nthem. &quot;Hail, Ranyhyn! Land-riders and proud-bearers. Sun-flesh and\nskymane, we are glad that you have heard our call. We must go on a long journey\nof many days. Will you bear us?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>In response, a few of the horses\nnodded their heads, and several others pranced in circles like colts. Then they\nmoved forward, each approaching a specific Bloodguard and nuzzling him as if\nurging him to mount. This the Bloodguard did, though the horses were without\nsaddle or bridle. Riding bareback, the Bloodguard trotted the Ranyhyn in a\ncircle around the company, and arrayed themselves beside the mounted warriors.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant felt that the departure\nof the company was imminent, and he did not want to miss his chance. Stepping\nclose to Osondrea, he asked, &quot;What does it mean? Where did they come\nfrom?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The Lord turned and answered\nalmost eagerly, as if glad for any distraction, &quot;Of course-you are a\nstranger. Now, how can I explain such a deep matter briefly? Consider-the\nRanyhyn are free, untamed, and their home is in the Plains of Ra. They are\ntended by the Ramen, but they are never ridden unless</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>they choose a rider for\nthemselves. It is a free choice. And once a Ranyhyn selects a rider, it is\nfaithful to that one though fire and death interdict.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Few are chosen. Tamarantha\nis the only living Lord to be blessed with a Ranyhyn mount-Hynaril bears her\nproudlythough neither Prothall nor Mhoram have yet made the trial. Prothall has\nbeen unwilling. But I suspect that one of his reasons for journeying south is\nto give Mhoram a chance to be chosen.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;No matter. Since the age of\nHigh Lord Kevin, a bond has grown up between the Ranyhyn and the Bloodguard.\nFor many reasons, only some of which I can guess, no Bloodguard has remained\nunchosen.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;As to the coming here of the\nRanyhyn today-that surpasses my explaining. They are creatures of Earthpower.\nIn some way, each Ranyhyn knows when its rider will call-yes, knows, and never\nfails to answer. Here are Huryn, Brabha, Marny, and others. Ten days ago they\nheard the call which only reached our ears this morning-and after more than\nfour hundred leagues, they arrive as fresh as the dawn. If we could match them,\nthe Land would not be in such peril.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>As she had been speaking, Prothall\nand Mhoram had mounted their horses, and she finished while walking Covenant\ntoward his mustang. Under the influence of her voice, he went up to the animal\nwithout hesitation. But when he put his foot in the stirrup of the clingor\nsaddle he felt a spasm of reluctance. He did not like horses, did not trust\nthem; their strength was too dangerous. He backed away, and found that his\nhands were trembling.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Osondrea regarded him curiously;\nbut before she could say anything a bustle of surprise ran through the company.\nWhen he looked up, Covenant saw three old figures riding forward-the Lords\nVariol and Tamarantha, and Hearthrall Birinair. Tamarantha sat astride a great\nroan Ranyhyn mare with laughing eyes.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Bowing toward them from the back\nof his horse, High Lord Prothall said, &quot;I am glad that you have come. We\nneed your blessing before we depart, just as Osondrea needs your help.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Tamarantha bowed in return, but\nthere was a sly half-smile on her wrinkled lips. She scanned the company\nbriefly. &quot;You have chosen well, Prothall.&quot; Then she brought her old\neyes back to the High Lord. &quot;But you mistake us. We go with you.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Prothall began to object, but\nBirinair put in stoutly, &quot;Of course. What else? A Quest without a\nHirebrand, indeed!&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Birinair,&quot; said\nProthall reprovingly, &quot;surely our work for the Seareach Giants requires\nyou.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Requires? Of course. As to\nthat, why,&quot; the Hirebrand huffed, &quot;as to that-no. Shames me to say\nit. I have given all the orders. No. The others are abler. Have been for\nyears.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Prothall,&quot; Tamarantha\nurged, &quot;do not forbid. We are old-of course we are old. And the way will\nbe long and hard. But this is the great challenge of our time-the only high and\nbold enterprise in which we will ever be able to share.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Is the defense of Revelstone\nthen such a little thing?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Variol jerked up his head as if\nProthall's question had been a gibe. &quot;Revelstone remembers we have</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>failed to retrieve any of Kevin's\nLore. What possible help can we be here? Osondrea is more than enough. Without\nthis Quest, our lives will be wasted.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;No, my Lords-no. Not\nwasted,&quot; Prothall murmured. With a baffled expression, he looked to Mhoram\nfor support. Smiling crookedly, Mhoram said; &quot;Life is well designed. Men\nand women grow old so that someone will be wise enough to teach the young. Let\nthem come.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>After another moment's hesitation,\nProthall .decided. &quot;Come, then. You will teach us all.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Variol smiled up at Tamarantha,\nand she returned his gaze from the high back of the Ranyhyn. Their faces were\nfull of satisfaction and calm expectancy, which they shared in the silent\nmarriage of their eyes. Watching them, Covenant abruptly snatched up his\nhorse's reins and climbed into the saddle. His heart thudded anxiously, but\nalmost at once the clingor gave him a feeling of security which eased his\ntrepidation. Following the example of Prothall and Mhoram, he slid the staff\nunder his left thigh, where it was held by the clingor. Then he gripped the\nmustang with his. knees and tried not to fret.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The man who had been holding the\nhorse touched Covenant's knee to get his attention. &quot;Her name is Dura-Dura\nFairflank. Horses are rare in the Land. I have trained her well. She is as good\nas a Ranyhyn,&quot; he boasted, then lowered his eyes as if embarrassed by his\nexaggeration.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant replied gruffly, &quot;I\ndon't want a Ranyhyn.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The man took this as approval of\nDura, and beamed with pleasure. As he moved away, he touched his palms to his\nforehead and spread his arms wide in salute.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>From his new vantage, Covenant\nsurveyed the company. There were no packhorses, but attached to every saddle\nwere bags of provisions and tools, and Birinair had a thick bundle of\nlillianrill rods behind him. The Bloodguard were unencumbered, but Foamfollower\ncarried his huge sack over his shoulder, and looked ready to travel as fast as\nany horse.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Shortly, Prothall rose in his\nstirrups and called out over the company, &quot;My friends, we must depart. The\nQuest is urgent, and the time of our trial presses upon us. I will not try to\nstir your hearts with long words or bind you with awesome oaths. But I give you\ntwo charges. Be true to the limit of your strength. And remember the Oath of\nPeace. We go into danger, and perhaps into war-we will fight if need be. But\nthe Land will not be served by angry bloodshed. Remember the Code:</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Do not hurt where holding is\nenough;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>do not wound where hurting is\nenough; do not maim where wounding is enough; and kill not where maiming is\nenough;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>the greatest warrior is one who\ndoes not need to kill.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Then the High Lord wheeled his\nmount to face Revelstone. He drew out his staff, swung it three times</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>about his head, and raised it to\nthe sky. From its end, a blue incandescent flame burst. And he cried to the\nKeep &quot;Hail, Revelstone.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The entire population of the Keep\nresponded with one mighty, heart-shaking shout: &quot;Hail!&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>That myriad-throated paean sprang\nacross the hills; the dawn air itself seemed to vibrate with praise and\nsalutation. Several of the Ranyhyn nickered joyously. In answer, Covenant\nclenched his teeth against a sudden thickening in his throat. He felt unworthy.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Then Prothall turned his horse and\nurged it into a canter down the hillside. Swiftly, the company swung into place\naround him. Mhoram guided Covenant to a position behind Prothall, ahead of\nVariol and Tamarantha. Four Bloodguard flanked the Lords on either side, Quaan,\nTuvor, and Korik rode ahead of Prothall, and behind came Birinair and the\nEoman. With a long, loping stride, Foamfollower pulled abreast of Mhoram and\nCovenant, where he jogged as easily as if such traveling were natural to him.\nThus the Quest for the Staff of Law left Lord's Keep in the sunlight of a new\nday.<br clear=all style='page-break-before:always'>\n</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><a name=\"_Toc370739021\"><span class=Heading1Char><span\nstyle='font-size:16.0pt;line-height:105%'>SIXTEEN: Blood-Bourne</span></span></a></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Thomas Covenant spent the next\nthree days in one long, acute discovery of saddle soreness. Sitting on thin\nleather, he felt as if he were riding bareback; the hard, physical fact of\nDura's spine threatened to saw him open. His knees felt as if they were being\ntwisted out of joint; his thighs and calves ached and quivered with the strain\nof gripping his mount-a pain which slowly spread into and up his back; and his\npeck throbbed from the lash of Dura's sudden lurchings as she crossed the\nobstacles of the terrain. At times, he remained on her back only because the\nclingor saddle did not let him fall. And at night his clenched muscles hurt so\nbadly that he could not sleep without the benefit of diamondraught.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>As a result, he noticed little of\nthe passing countryside, or the weather, or the mood of the company. He ignored\nor rebuffed every effort to draw him into conversation. He was consumed by the\npainful sensation of being broken in half. Once again, he was forced to\nrecognize the suicidal nature of this dream, of what the subconscious darkness\nof his mind was doing to him.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>But the Giant's diamondraught and\nthe Land's impossible health worked in him regardless of 'his suffering. His\nflesh grew tougher to meet the demands of Dura's back. And without knowing it\nhe had been improving as a rider. He was learning how to move with instead of\nresisting his mount. When he woke up after .the third night,. he found that\nphysical hurting no longer dominated him.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>By that time, the company had left\nbehind the cultivated region around Revelstone, and had moved out into rough\nplains. They had camped in the middle of a rude flatland; and when Covenant\nbegan to look about him, the terrain that met his eyes was rocky and\nunpromising.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Nevertheless, the sense of moving\nforward reasserted itself in him, gave him once again the illusion of safety.\nLike so many other things, Revelstone was behind him. When Foamfollower\naddressed him, he</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>was able to respond without\nviolence.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>At that, the Giant remarked to\nMhoram, &quot;Stone and Sea, my Lord! I believe that Thomas Covenant has chosen\nto rejoin the living. Surely this is the work of diamondraught. Hail, ur-Lord\nCovenant. Welcome to our company. Do you know, Lord Mhoram, there is an ancient\nGiantish tale about a war which was halted by diamondraught? Would you like to\nhear? I can tell it in half a day.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Indeed?&quot; Mhoram chuckled.\n&quot;And will it take only half a day if you tell it on the run, while we\nride?&quot; Foamfollower laughed broadly. &quot;Then I can be done by sunset\ntomorrow. I, Saltheart Foamfollower,</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>say &quot;I have heard that\ntale,&quot; High Lord Prothall said.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;But the teller assured me\nthat diamondraught did not in fact end the conflict. The actual rein was\nGiantish talk. When the Giants were done asking after the causes of the war,\nthe combatants had been listening so long that they had forgotten the\nanswer.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Ali, High Lord,&quot; Foamfollower\nchortled, &quot;you misunderstand. It was the Giants who drank the\ndiamondraught.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Laughter burst from the listening\nwarriors, and Prothall smiled as he turned to mount his horse. Soon the Quest\nwas on its way, and Covenant fell into place beside Mhoram.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Now as he rode, Covenant listened\nto the traveling noises of the company. The Lords and Bloodguard were almost\nentirely silent, preoccupied; but over the thud of hooves, he could hear talk\nand snatches of song from the warriors. In Quaan's leadership, they sounded\nconfident and occasionally eager, as if they looked forward to putting their.\nyears of Sword training to the test.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Sometime later, Lord Mhoram\nsurprised Covenant by saying without preamble, &quot;Ur-Lord, as you know there\nwere questions which the Council did not ask of you. May I ask them now? I\nshould like to know more concerning your world.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;My world.&quot; Covenant\nswallowed roughly. He did not want to talk about it; he had no desire to repeat\nthe ordeal of the Council. &quot;Why?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Mhoram shrugged. &quot;Because the\nmore I know of you, the better I will know what to expect from you in times of\nperil. Or because an understanding of your world may teach me to treat you\nrightly. Or because I have asked the question in simple friendship.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant could hear the candor in\nMhoram's voice, and it disarmed his refusals. He owed the Lords and himself\nsome kind of honesty. But that debt was bitter to him, and he could not find\nany easy way to articulate all the things which needed saying. Instinctively,\nhe began to make a list. We have cancer, heart failure, tuberculosis, multiple\nsclerosis, birth defects, leprosy-we have alcoholism, venereal disease, drug\naddiction, rape, robbery, murder, child beating, genocide-but he could not bear\nto utter a catalog of woes that might run on forever. After a moment, he stood\nin his stirrups and gestured out over the ruggedness of the plains.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;You probably see it better\nthan I do-but even I can tell that this is beautiful. It's alive-it's alive the\nway it should be alive. This kind of grass is yellow and stiff and thin-but I\ncan see that it's healthy. It belongs here, in this kind of soil. By hell! I\ncan even see what time of year this is by looking at the dirt. I can se</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>spring.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Where I come from we don't\nsee- If you don't know the annual cycles of the plants, you can't tell the\ndifference between spring and summer. If you don't have a-have a standard of\ncomparison, you can't recognize- But the world is beautiful-what's left of it,\nwhat we haven't damaged.&quot; Images of Haven Farm sprang irrefusably across\nhis mind. He could not restrain the mordancy of his tone as he concluded,\n&quot;We have beauty, too. We call it `scenery.' &quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot; `Scenery,' &quot; Mhoram\nechoed. &quot;The word is strange to me-but I do not like the sound.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant felt oddly shaken, as if\nhe had just looked over his shoulder and found himself standing too close to a\nprecipice. &quot;It means that beauty is something extra,&quot; he rasped.\n&quot;It's nice, but we can live without it.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Without?&quot; Mhoram's gaze\nglittered dangerously.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>And behind him Foamfollower\nbreathed in astonishment, &quot;Live without beauty? Ah, my friend! How do you\nresist despair?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;I don't think we do,&quot;\nCovenant muttered. &quot;Some of us are just stubborn.&quot; Then he fell\nsilent. Mhoram asked him no more questions, and he rode on chewing the gristle\nof his thoughts until High Lord Prothall called a rest halt.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>As the day progressed, Covenant's\nsilence seemed slowly to infect the company. The traveling banter and singing\nof the Eoman faded gradually into stillness; Mhoram watched Covenant curiously\naskance, but made no effort to renew their conversation; and Prothall looked as\nnight-faced as the Bloodguard.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>After a time, Covenant guessed the\ncause of their reticence. Tonight would be the first full of the bloody moon.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>A shiver ran through him. That\nnight would be a kind of test of Drool's power. H the Cavewight could maintain\nhis red hold even when the moon was full, then the Lords would have to admit\nthat his might had no discernible limit. And such might would be spawning\narmies, would almost certainly have already produced marauders to feed Drool's\ntaste for pillage. Then the company would have to fight for passage. Covenant\nremembered with a shudder his brief meeting with Drool in the cavern of Kiril\nThrendor. Like his companions, he fell under the pall of what the night might\nreveal.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Only Variol and Tamarantha seemed\nuntouched by the common mood. She appeared half-asleep, and rode casually,\ntrusting the Ranyhyn to keep her on its back. Her husband sat erect, with a\nsteady hand on his i reins, but his mouth was slack and his eyes unfocused. I\nThey looked frail; Covenant felt that he could see the brittleness of their\nbones. But they alone of all the company were blithe against the coming\nnight-blithe or uncomprehending.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The riders camped before dusk on\nthe north side of a rough hill, partially sheltered from the prevailing\nsouthwest breeze. The air had turned cold like a revisitation of winter, and\nthe wind carried a chill to the hearts of the travelers. In silence, some of\nthe warriors fed and rubbed down the horses, while others cooked a spare meal\nover a fire that Birinair coaxed from one of his lillianrill rods and some\nscrub wood. The Ranyhyn galloped away together to spend the might in some\nsecret play or rite, leaving the horses lobbied and the Bloodguard standing\nsentinel and the rest of the company huddled in their cloaks mound the fire. As\nthe last of the sunlight scudded tom the air, the breeze stiffened into a\nsteady wind.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant found himself wishing for\nsome of the camaraderie that had begun the day. But he could not supply the\nlack himself; he had to wait until High Lord Prothall rose to meet the\napprehension of the Quest.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Planting his staff firmly, he\nbegan to sing the Vespers hymn of Revelstone. Mhoram joined him, followed by\nVariol and Tamarantha, and soon the whole Eoman was on its feet, adding its\nmany throated voice to the song. There they stood under the stern sky,\ntwenty-five souls singing like witnesses:</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Seven hells for failed faith,</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>For Land's betrayers, man and\nwraith: And one brave Lord to deal the doom To keep the blacking blight from\nBeauty's bloom.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>They raised their voices bravely,\nand their melody was counterpointed by the tenor roll of Foamfollower's\nplainsong. When they were done, they reseated themselves and began to talk\ntogether in low voices, as if the hymn were all they needed to restore their\ncourage.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant sat staring at his\nknotted hands. Without taking his eyes off them, he knew when moonrise came; he\nfelt the sudden stiffening around him as the first crimson glow appeared on the\nhorizon. But he gnawed on his lip and did not look up. His companions breathed\ntensely; a red cast slowly deepened in the heart of the fire; but he clenched\nhis gaze as if he were studying the way his knuckles whitened.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Then he heard Lord Mhoram's\nagonized whisper, &quot;Melenkurion,&quot; and he knew that the moon was full\nred, stained as if its defilement were complete-as bloody as if the night sky\nhad been cut to the heart. He felt the light touch his face, and his cheek\ntwitched in revulsion.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The next moment, there came a\ndistant wail like a cry of protest. It throbbed like desolation in the chill\nair. In spite of himself, Covenant looked over the blood-hued plain; for an\ninstant, he expected the company to leap to the relief of that call. But no one\nmoved. The cry must have come from some animal. Glancing briefly at the full\nviolated moon, he changed his grip and lowered his eyes again.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>When his gaze reached his fingers,\nhe saw in horror that the moonlight gave his ring a reddish cast. The metal\nlooked as if it had been dipped in blood. Its inner silver struggled to show\nthrough the crimson, but the bloodlight seemed to be soaking inward,</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>slowly quenching, perverting the\nwhite gold.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>He understood instinctively. For\none staggering heartbeat, he sat still, howled silent and futile warnings at\nhis unsuspecting self. Then he sprang to his feet, erect and rigid as if he had\nbeen yanked upright by the moon-arms tight at his sides, fists clenched.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Behind him, Bannor said, &quot;Do\nnot fear, ur-Lord. The Ranyhyn will warn us if the wolves are any danger.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant turned his head. The\nBloodguard reached a restraining hand toward him. &quot;Don't touch me!&quot;\nCovenant hissed.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>He jerked away from Bannor. For an\ninstant while his heart labored, he observed how the crimson moon made Bannor's\nface look like old lava. Then a vicious sense of wrong exploded under his feet,\nand he pitched toward the fire.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>As he struck the earth he flung\nhimself onward, careless of everything but his intense visceral need to escape\nthe attack. After one roll, his legs crashed among the flaming brands.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>But as Covenant fell, Bannor\nsprang forward. When Covenant hit the fire, the Bloodguard was only a stride\naway. He caught Covenant's wrist in almost the same instant, heaved him\nchild-light out of the flames and onto his feet.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Even before he had regained his\nbalance, Covenant spun on Bannor and yelled into the Bloodguard's face,\n&quot;Don't touch me!&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Bannor released Covenant's wrist,\nbacked away a step.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Prothall, Mhoram, Foamfollower,\nand all the wards were on their feet. They stared at Covenant in reprise,\nconfusion, outrage.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>He felt suddenly weak. His legs\ntrembled; he gypped to his knees beside the fire. Thinking, Hell and bloody\nFoul has done it to me, he's taking me over damnation! he pointed an unsteady\nfinger at the ground that had stung him. &quot;There,&quot; he gasped. &quot;It\nwas there. I felt it.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The Lords reacted immediately.\nWhile Mhoram shouted for Birinair, Prothall hurried forward and stooped over\nthe spot Covenant indicated. Mumbling softly to himself, he touched the spot\nwith the tips of his fingers like a physician testing a wound. Then he was\njoined by Mhoram and Birinair. Birinair thrust the High Lord aside, took his\nlillianrill staff and placed its end on the sore place. Rotating the staff between\nhis palms, he concentrated imperiously on his beloved wood.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;For one moment,&quot;\nProthall murmured, &quot;for one moment I felt something-some memory in the\nEarth. Then it passed beyond my touch.&quot; He sighed. &quot;It was\nterrible.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Birinair echoed,\n&quot;Terrible,&quot; talking to himself in his concentration. Prothall and\nMhoram watched him as his hands trembled with either age or sensitivity.\nAbruptly, he cried, &quot;Terrible! The hand of the Slayer! He dares do\nthis?&quot; He snatched himself away so quickly that he stumbled, and would\nhave fallen if Prothall had not caught him.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Momentarily, Prothall and Birinair\nmet each other's eyes as if they were trying to exchange some knowledge that\ncould not be voiced. Then Birinair shook himself free. Looking about him as if\nhe could see the shards of his dignity scattered around his feet, he mumbled\ngruffly, &quot;Stand on my own. Not that old yet.&quot; After a glance at\nCovenant, he went on more loudly, &quot;You think I am old. Of course. Old and\nfoolish. Push himself into a Quest when he should be resting his bones by the\nhearth. Like a lump.&quot; Pointing toward the Unbeliever, he concluded,\n&quot;Ask him. Ask.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant had climbed to his feet\nwhile the attention of the company was on the Hirebrand, and had pushed his\nhands into his pockets to hide the hue of his ring. As Birinair pointed at him,\nhe raised his eyes</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>from the ground. A sick feeling of\npresage twisted his stomach as he remembered his attacks in Andelain, and what\nhad followed them.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Prothall said firmly, &quot;Step\nthere again, ur-Lord.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Grimacing, Covenant strode forward\nand stamped his foot on the spot. As his heel hit the ground, he winced in\nexpectation, tried to brace himself for the sensation that at this one point\nthe earth had become insecure, foundationless. But nothing stung him. As in Andelain,\nthe ill had vanished, leaving him with the impression that a veneer of\ntrustworthiness had been replaced over a pit.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>In answer to the silent question\nof the Lords, he shook his head. After a pause, Mhoram said evenly, &quot;You\nhave felt this before.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>With an effort, Covenant forced\nhimself to say, &quot;Yes. Several times-in Andelain. Before that attack on the\nCelebration.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;The hand of the Gray Slayer\ntouched you,&quot; Birinair spat. But he could not sustain his accusation. His\nbones seemed to remember their age, and ire sagged tiredly, leaned on his\nstaff. In an odd tone of self reproach, as if he were apologizing, he mumbled,\n&quot;Of course. Younger. If I were younger.&quot; He tamed from the company\nand shuffled away to his iced beyond the circle.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Why did you not tell us?&quot;\nMhoram asked severely.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The question made Covenant feel\nsuddenly ashamed, as if his ring were visible through the fabric of his pants.\nHis shoulders hunched, drove his hands deeper into his pockets. &quot;I\ndidn't-at first I didn't want you to know what-how important Foul and Drool\nmink I am. After that&quot;-he referred to his crisis in the Close with his\neyes-&quot;I was thinking about other Mhoram accepted this with a nod, and\nafter a moment Covenant went on: &quot;I don't know what it is. But I only get\nit through my boots. I can't touch it--with my hands or my feet.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Mhoram and Prothall shared a\nglance of surprise. Shortly, the High Lord said, &quot;Unbeliever, the cause if\nthese attacks surpasses me. Why do your boots make you sensitive to this wrong?\nI do not know. But either Lord Mhoram or myself must remain by you at all\ntimes, so that we may respond without delay.&quot; Over his shoulder, he said,\n&quot;First Mark Tuvor. Warhaft Quaan. Have you heard?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Quaan came to attention and\nreplied, &quot;Yes, High Lord.&quot; And from behind the circle Tuvor's voice\ncarried softly, &quot;There will be an attack. We have heard.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Readiness will be\nneeded,&quot; said Mhoram grimly, &quot;and stout hearts to face an onslaught\nof ur-viles and wolves and Cavewights without faltering.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;That is so,&quot; the High\nLord said at last. &quot;But such things will come in their own time. Now we\nmust rest. We must gather strength.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Slowly, the company began the\nbusiness of bedding down. Humming his Giantish plainsong, Foamfollower\nstretched out on the ground with his arm around his leather flask of\ndiamondraught. While the Bloodguard set watches, the warriors spread blankets\nfor themselves and the Lords. Covenant went to bed self consciously, as if he\nfelt the company studying him, and he was glad of the blankets that helped him\nhide his ring. Then he lay awake long into the night, feeling too cold to\nsleep; the blankets did not keep out the chill which emanated from his ring.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>But until he finally fell asleep,\nhe could hear Foam follower's humming and see Prothall sitting by the embers of\nthe fire. The Giant and the High Lord kept watch together, two old friends of\nthe Land sharing some vigil against their impending doom.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The next day dawned gray and\ncheerless-overcast with clouds like ashes in the sky-and into it Covenant rode\nbent in his saddle as if he had a weight around his neck. His ring had lost its\nred stain with the setting of the moon; but the color remained in his mind, and\nthe ring seemed to drag him down like a meaningless crime. Helplessly, he\nperceived that an allegiance he had not chosen, could not have chosen,</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>was being forced upon him. The\nevidence seemed irrefutable. Like the moon, he was falling prey to Lord Foul's\nmachinations. His volition was not required; the strings which dangled him were\nstrong enough to overbear any resistance.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>He did not understand how it could\nhappen to him. Was his death wish, his leper's weariness or despair, so strong?\nWhat had become of his obdurate instinct for survival? Where was his anger, his\nviolence? Had he been victimized for so long that now he could only respond as\na victim, even to himself?</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>He had no answers. He was sure of\nnothing but the fear which came over him when the company halted at noon. He\nfound that he did not want to get down from Dura's back.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>He distrusted the ground, dreaded\ncontact with it. He had lost a fundamental confidence: his faith that the earth\nwas stable-a faith so obvious and constant and necessary that it had been\nunconscious until now -had been shaken. Blind silent soil had become a dark\nhand malevolently seeking out him and him alone.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Nevertheless, he swung down from\nthe saddle, forced himself to set foot on the ground and was stung. The\nvirulence of the sensation made all his nerves cringe, and he could hardly\nstand as he watched Prothall and Mhoram and Birinair try to capture what he had\nfelt. But they failed completely; the misery of that ill touch withdrew the\ninstant he jumped away from it.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>That evening during supper he was\nstung again. When he went to bed to hide his ring from the moon, he shivered as\nif he were feverish. On the morning of the sixth day, he arose with a gray face\nand a crippled look in his eyes. Before he could mount Nomura he was stung\nagain.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>And again during one of the\ncompany's rest halts.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>And again the instant he mustered\nenough despair to dismount at the end of the day's ride. The wrong felt like\nanother spike in his coffin lid. This time, his nerves reacted so violently\nthat he tumbled to the ground like a demonstration of futility. He had to lie\nstill for a long time before he could coax his arms and legs under control\nagain, and when he finally regained feet, he jerked and winced with fear at\nevery step.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Pathetic, pathetic, he panted to\nhimself. But he could not find the rage to master it.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>With keen concern in his eyes,\nFoamfollower asked him why he did not take off his boots. Covenant had to think\nfor a moment before he could remember why. Then he murmured, &quot;They're part\nof me-they're part of the way I have to live. I don't have very many parts\nleft. And besides,&quot; he added wanly, &quot;if I don't keep having these\nfits, how is Prothall going to figure them out?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Do not do such a thing for\nus,&quot; Mhoram replied intently. &quot;How could we ask it?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>But Covenant only shrugged and\nwent to sit by the fire. He could not face food that night-the thought of</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>eating made his raw nerves\nnauseous-but he tried a few aliantha from a bush near the camp, and found that\nthey had a calming effect. He ate a handful of the berries, absentmindedly\ntossing away the seeds as Lena had taught him, and returned to the fire.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>When the company had finished its\nmeal, Mhoram seated himself beside Covenant. Without looking at him, the Lord\nasked, &quot;How can we help you? Should we build a litter so that you will not\nhave to touch the earth? Or are there other ways? Perhaps one of Foamfollower's\ntales would ease your heart. I have heard Giants boast that the Despiser\nhimself would become an Earthfriend if he could be made to listen to the story\nof Bahgoon the Unbearable and Thelma Twofist -such healing there is in\nstories.&quot; Abruptly, Mhoram turned squarely toward Covenant, and Covenant\nsaw that the Lord's face was full of sympathy. &quot;I see your pain,\nur-Lord.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant hung his head to avoid\nMhoram's gaze, made sure his left hand was securely in his pocket. After a\nmoment, he said distantly, &quot;Tell me about the Creator.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Ah,&quot; Mhoram sighed,\n&quot;we do not know that a Creator lives. Our only lore of such a being comes\nfrom the most shadowy reaches of our oldest legends. We know the Despiser. But\nthe Creator we do not know.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Then Covenant was vaguely startled\nto hear Lord Tamarantha cut in, &quot;Of course we know. Ah, the folly of the\nyoung. Mhoram my son, you are not yet a prophet. You must learn that kind of\ncourage.&quot; Slowly, she pulled her ancient limbs together and got to her\nfeet, leaning on her staff for support. Her thin white hair hung in wisps about\nher face as she moved into the circle around the fire, muttering frailty,\n&quot;Oracles and prophecy are incompatible. According to Kevin's Lore, only\nHeartthew the Lord-Fatherer was both seer and prophet. Lesser souls lose the\nparadox. Why, I do not know. But when Kevin Landwaster decided in his heart to\ninvoke the Ritual of Desecration, he saved the Bloodguard and the Ranyhyn and\nthe Giants because he was an oracle. And because he was no prophet he failed to\nsee that Lord Foul would survive. A lesser man than Berek. Of course the\nCreator lives.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>She looked over at Variol for\nconfirmation, and he nodded, but Covenant could not tell whether he was\napproving or drowsing. But Tamarantha nodded in return as if Variol had\nsupported her. Lifting her head to the night sky and the stars, she spoke in a\nvoice fragile with age.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Of course the Creator\nlives,&quot; she repeated. &quot;How else? Opposites require each other.\nOtherwise the difference is lost, and only chaos remains. No, there can be no\nDespite without Creation. Better to ask how the Creator could have forgotten\nthat when he made the Earth. For if he did not forget, then Creation and\nDespite existed together in his one being, and he did not know it.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;This the elder legends tell\nus: into the infinity before Time was made came the Creator like a worker into\nhis workshop. And since it is the nature of creating to desire perfection, the\nCreator devoted all himself to the task. First he built the arch of Time, so that\nhis creation would have a place in which to beard for the keystone of that arch\nhe forged the wild magic, so that Time would be able to resist chaos and\nendure. Then within the arch he formed the Earth. For ages he labored, formed\nand unformed, trialed and tested and rejected and trialed and tested again, so\nthat when he was done his creation would have no cause to reproach him. And\nwhen the Earth was fair to his eye, he gave birth to the inhabitants of the\nEarth, beings to act out in their lives his reach for perfection-and he did not\nneglect to give them the means to strive for perfection themselves. When he was\ndone, he was proud as only those who create can be.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Alas, he did not understand\nDespite, or had forgotten it. He undertook his task thinking that perfect labor\nwas all that he required to create perfection. But when he was done, and his\npride had tasted its</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>first satisfaction, he looked\nclosely at the Earth, thinking to gratify himself with the sight-and he was\ndismayed. For, behold! Buried deep in the Earth through no will or forming of\nhis were banes of destruction, powers virile enough to rip his masterwork into\ndust.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Then he understood or\nremembered. Perhaps he found Despite itself beside him, misguiding his hand.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Or perhaps he saw the harm in\nhimself. It does not matter. He became outraged with grief and torn pride. In\nhis fury he wrestled with Despite, either within him or without, and in his\nfury he. cast the Despiser down, out of the infinity of the cosmos onto the\nEarth.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Alas! thus the Despiser was\nemprisoned within Time. And thus the Creator's creation became the Despiser's\nworld, to torment as he chose. For the very Law of Time, the principle of power\nwhich made the arch possible, worked to preserve Lord Foul, as we now call him.\nThat Law requires that no act may be undone. Desecration may not be\nundone-defilement may not be recanted. It may be survived or healed, but not\ndenied. Therefore Lord Foul has afflicted the Earth, and the Creator cannot\nstop him-for it was the Creator's act which placed Despite here.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;In sorrow and humility, the\nCreator saw what he had done. So that the plight of the Earth would not be\nutterly without hope, he sought to help his creation in indirect ways. He\nguided the Lord-Fatherer to the fashioning of the Staff of Lawa weapon against\nDespite. But the very Law of the Earth's creation permits nothing more. If the\nCreator were to silence Lord Foul, that act would destroy Time-and then the\nDespiser would be free in infinity again, free to make whatever befoulments he\ndesired.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Tamarantha paused. She had told\nher tale simply, without towering rhetoric or agitation or any sign of passion\nbeyond her agedness. But for a moment, her thin old voice convinced Covenant\nthat the universe was at stake-that his own struggle was only a microcosm of a\nfar larger conflict. During that moment, he waited in suspense for what she\nwould say next.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Shortly, she lowered her head and\nturned her wrinkled gaze full on him. Almost whispering, she said, &quot;Thus\nwe are come to the greatest test. The wild magic is here. With a word our world\ncould be riven to the core. Do not mistake,&quot; she quavered. &quot;If we\ncannot win this Unbeliever to our cause, then the Earth will end in\nrubble.&quot; But Covenant could not tell whether her voice shook because she was\nold, or because she was afraid.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Moonrise was near; he went to his\nbed to avoid exposing the alteration of his ring. With his head under the\nblankets, he stared into the blackness, saw when the moon came up by the bloody\nglow which grew in his wedding band. The metal seemed more deeply stained than\nit had two nights ago. It held his covered gaze like a fixation; and when 'he\nfinally slept, he was as exhausted as if he had been worn out under an\ninterrogation.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The next morning, he managed to\nreach Dura's back without being attacked-and he groaned in unashamed relief.\nThen Prothall broke his usual habit and did not call for a halt at noon. The\nreason became clear when the riders topped a rise and came in sight of the\nSoulsease River. They rode down out of the harsh plains and swam their horses\nacross the river before stopping to rest. And there again Covenant was not\nattacked when he set foot on the ground.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>But the rest of the day contrasted\ngrimly with this inexplicable respite. A few leagues beyond the Soulsease, the\nQuest came upon a Waymeet for the first time. Remembering Covenant's tale of a\nmurdered Waynhim, Prothall sent two Bloodguard, Korik and Terrel (who warded\nLord Mhoram), into the Waymeet. The investigation was only necessary for\nconfirmation. Even Covenant in his straitened condition could see the neglect,\nsmell the disuse; the green travelers' haven had gone brown and sour. When\nKorik and Terrel returned, they could only report what the company had already\nperceived: the</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Waymeet was untended.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The Lords met this discovery with\nstern faces. Clearly, they had feared that the murder Covenant had described\nwould lead the Waynhim to end their service. But several of the warriors\ngroaned in shock and dismay, and Foamfollower ground his teeth. Covenant glanced\naround at the Giant, and for a moment saw Foamfollower's face suffused with\nfury. The expression passed quickly, but it left Covenant feeling shaken.\nUnexpectedly, he sensed that the unmarred loyalty of the Giants to the Land was\ndangerous; it was quick to judge.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>So there was a gloom on the\ncompany at the end of the seventh day, a gloom which could only be aggravated\nby the moon, incarnadine and corrupt, as it colored the night like a conviction\nof disaster. Only Covenant received any relief; once again, his private,\nstalking ill left him alone. But the next day brought the riders in sight of\nAndelain. Their path lay along the outskirts of the Hills on the southwest\nside, and even through the hanging gray weather, the richness of Andelain\nglistened like the proudest gem of the Earth. It made the company feel\nlight-boned, affected the Quest like a living view of what the Land had been\nlike before the Desecration.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant needed that quiet\nconsolation as much as anyone, but it was denied him. While eating breakfast,\nhe had been bitten again by the wrong in the earth. The previous day's respite\nseemed only to multiply the virulence of the attack; it was compact with\nmalevolence, as if that respite had frustrated it, intensified its spite. The\nsensation of wrong left him foundering.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>During one of the rest halts, he\nwas struck again.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>And that evening, while he made\nhimself a supper of aliantha, he was 'struck again. This time the wrong lashed\nhim so viciously that he passed out for some time. When he regained\nconsciousness, he was lying in Foamfollower's arms like a child. He felt\nvaguely that he had had convulsions.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Take off your boots,&quot;\nFoamfollower urged intently.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Numbness filled Covenant's head\nlike mist, clouded his reactions. But he mustered the lucidity to ask,\n&quot;Why?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Why? Stone and Sea, my\nfriend! When you ask like that, how can I answer? Ask yourself. What do you\ngain by enduring such wrong?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Myself,&quot; he murmured\nfaintly. He wanted simply to recline in the Giant's arms and sleep, but he\nfought the desire, pushed himself away from Foamfollower until the Giant set\nhim on his feet by Birinair's lillianrill fire. For a moment, he had to cling\ndecrepitly to Foamfollower's arm to support himself, but then one of the\nwarriors gave him his staff, and he braced himself on it. &quot;By\nresisting.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>But he knew in his bones that he\nwas not resisting. They felt weak, as if they were melting under the strain.\nHis boots had become a hollow symbol for an intransigence he no longer felt.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Foamfollower started to object, but\nMhoram stopped him. &quot;It is his choice,&quot; the Lord said softly.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>After a while, Covenant fell into\nfeverish sleep. He did not know that he was carried tenderly to bed, did not\nknow that Mhoram watched over him during the night, and saw the bloody stain on\nhis wedding band.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>He reached some sort of crisis\nwhile he slept, and awoke with the feeling that he had lost, that his ability</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>to endure had reached the final\neither-or of a toss which had gone against him. His throat was parched like a\nbattleground. When he forced his eyes open, he found himself again prostrated\nin Foamfollower's arms. Around him, the company was ready to mount for the\nday's ride.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>When he saw Covenant's eyes open,\nFoamfollower bent over him and said quietly, &quot;I would rather bear You in\nmy arms than see you suffer. Our journey to Lord's Keep was easier for me than\nwatching you now.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Part of Covenant rallied to look\nat the Giant. Foamfollower's face showed strain, but it was not the strain of\nexhaustion. Rather, it seemed like a pressure building up in his mind-a\npressure that made the fortress of his forehead appear to bulge. Covenant\nstared at it dumbly for a long moment before he realized that it was sympathy.\nThe sight of his own pain made Foamfollower's pulse throb in his temples.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Giants? Covenant breathed to\nhimself. Are they all like this? Watching that concentration of emotion, he\nmurmured, &quot;What's a 'foamfollower'?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The Giant did not appear to notice\nthe irrelevance of the question. &quot;A `follower' is a compass,&quot; he\nanswered simply. &quot;So 'foam-follower'-'sea-compass.&quot;' Covenant began\nweakly moving, trying to get out of the Giant's arms. But Foamfollower held\nhim, forbade him in silence to set his feet on the ground.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Lord Mhoram intervened. With grim\ndetermination in his voice, he said, &quot;Set him down.&quot;\n&quot;Down,&quot; Covenant echoed.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Several retorts passed under\nFoamfollower's heavy brows, but he only said, &quot;Why?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;I have decided,&quot; Mhoram\nreplied. &quot;We will not move from this place until we understand what is\nhappening to ur-Lord Covenant. I have delayed this risk too long. Death gathers\naround us. Set him down.&quot; His eyes flashed dangerously.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Still Foamfollower hesitated until\nhe saw High Lord Prothall nod support for Mhoram. Then he turned Covenant\nupright and lowered him gently to the ground. For an instant, his hands rested\nprotectively on Covenant's shoulders. Then he stepped back.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Now, ur-Lord,&quot; said\nMhoram. &quot;Give me your hand. We will stand together until you feel the ill,\nand I feel it through you.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>At that, a coil of weak panic\nwrithed in Covenant's heart. He saw himself reflected in Mhoram's eyes, , saw\nhimself standing lornly with what he had lost written in his face. That loss\ndismayed him. In that tiny, reflected face he perceived abruptly that if the\nattacks continued he would inevitably learn to enjoy the sense of horror and\nloathing which they gave him. He had discovered a frontier into the narcissism\nof revulsion, and Mhoram was asking him to risk crossing over.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Come,&quot; the Lord urged,\nextending his right hand. &quot;We must understand this wrong if we are to\nresist it.&quot; In desperation or despair, Covenant thrust out his hand. The\nheels of their palms met; they gripped each other's thumbs. His two fingers\nfelt weak, hopeless for Mhoram's purpose, but the Lord's grasp was sturdy. Hand\nto hand like combatants, they stood there as though they were about to wrestle\nwith some bitter ghoul.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The attack came almost at once.\nCovenant cried out, shook as if his bones were gibbering, but he did not leap\naway. In the first instant, Mhoram's hard grip sustained him. Then the Lord\nthrew his arm around Covenant, clasped him to his, chest: The violence of\nCovenant's distress buffeted Mhoram, but he held his ground, gritted his\nembrace.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>As suddenly as it had come, the\nattack passed. With a groan, Covenant sagged in Mhoram's arms. Mhoram held him\nup until he moved and began to carry his own weight. Then, slowly, the Lord\nreleased him. For a moment, their faces appeared oddly similar; they had the\nsame haunted expression, the same sweat-damp hollow gaze. But shortly Covenant\ngave a shuddering sigh, and Mhoram straightened his shoulders-and the\nsimilarity faded.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;I was a fool,&quot; Mhoram\nbreathed. &quot;I should have known-That ill is Drool Rockworm, reaching out\nwith the power of the Staff to find you. He can sense pour presence by the\ntouch of your boots on the earth, because they are unlike anything made in the\nLand. Thus he knows where you are, and so where we are.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;It is my guess that you were\nuntouched the day we crossed the Soulsease because Drool expected us to move toward\nhim on the River, and was searching for us on water rather than on land. But he\nlearned his mistake, and regained contact with you yesterday.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The Lord paused, gave what he was\nsaying a chance to penetrate Covenant. Then he concluded, &quot;Ur-Lord, for the\nsake of us all-for the sake of the Land-you must not wear your boots. Drool\nalready knows too much of our movements. His servants are abroad.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant did not respond. Mhoram's\nwords seemed to sap the last of his strength. The trial had been too much for\nhim; with a sigh he fainted into the Lord's arms. So he did not see how\ncarefully his boots and clothes were removed and packed in Dura's\nsaddlebags-how tenderly his limbs were washed by the I Lords and dressed in a\nrobe of white samite-how sadly his ring was taken from his finger and placed on\na new patch of clingor over his heart-how gently he was cradled in Saltheart\nFoamfollower's arms throughout the long march of that day. He lay in darkness\nlike a sacrifice; he could hear the teeth of his leprosy devouring his flesh.\nThere was a smell of contempt around him, insisting on his impotence. But his\nlips were bowed in a placid smile, a look of fondness, as if he had come at\nlast to approve his disintegration.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>He continued to smile when he\nawoke late that night and found himself staring into the wide ghoul grin of the\nmoon. Slowly, his smile stretched into a taut grimace, a look of happiness or\nhatred. But then the moon was blocked out of his vision by Foamfollower's great\nbulk. The Giant's huge palms, each as large as Covenant's face, stroked his\nhead tenderly, and in time the caress had its effect on him. His eyes lost\ntheir ghastly appearance, and his face relaxed, drifted away from torment into\nrepose. Soon he was deep in a less perilous slumber.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The next day-the tenth of the\nQuest-he awoke calmly, as if he were held in numb truce or stasis between\nirreconcilable demands. A feeling of affectlessness pervaded him, as if he no\nlonger had the heart to care about himself. Yet he was hungry. He ate a large breakfast,\nand remembered to thank the Woodhelvennin woman who seemed to have assigned\nherself the task of providing for him. His new apparel he accepted with a\nrueful shrug, noticing in silent, dim sarcasm how easily after all he was able\nto shed himself-and how the white robe flattered his gaunt form as if he were\nborn to it. Then, dumbly, he mounted Dura.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>His companions watched him as if\nthey feared he would fall. He was weaker than he had realized; he</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>needed most of his concentration\nto keep his seat, but he was equal to the task. Gradually the Questers began to\nbelieve that he was out of danger. Among them, he rode through the sunshine and\nthe warm spring air along the flowered marge of Andelain-rode attenuated and\ncareless, as if he were locked between impossibilities.<br clear=all\nstyle='page-break-before:always'>\n</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><a name=\"_Toc370739022\"><span class=Heading1Char><span\nstyle='font-size:16.0pt;line-height:105%'>SEVENTEEN: End in Fire</span></span></a></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>That night, the company camped in\na narrow valley between two rocky hillsides half a league from the thick\ngrasses of Andelain. The warriors were cheery, recovering their natural spirits\nafter the tensions of the past few days, and they told stories and sang songs\nto the quiet audience of the Lords and Bloodguard. Though the Lords did not\nparticipate, they seemed glad to listen, and several times Mhoram and Quaan\ncould be heard chuckling together.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>But Covenant did not share the\nebullience of the Eoman. A heavy hand of blankness held shut the lid his\nemotions, and he felt separate, untouchable. Finally he went to his bed before\nthe warriors were done with their last song.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>He was awakened some time later by\na hand on his shoulder. Opening his eyes, he found Foamfollower stooping beside\nhim. The moon had nearly set. &quot;Arise,&quot; the Giant whispered. &quot;The\nRanyhyn have brought word. Wolves are hunting us. Ur-viles may not be far\nbehind. We must go.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant blinked sleepily at the\nGiant's benighted face for a moment. &quot;Why? Won't they follow?&quot;\n&quot;Make haste, ur-Lord. Terrel, Korik, and perhaps a, third of Quaan's Eoman\nwill remain here in ambush. They will scatter the pack. Come.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>But Covenant persisted. &quot;So\nwhat? They'll just fall back and follow again. Let me sleep.&quot; &quot;My\nfriend, you try my patience. Arise, and I will explain.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>With a sigh, Covenant rolled from\nhis blankets. While he tightened the sash of his robe, settled his sandals on\nhis feet, and assured himself of his staff and knife, his Woodhelvennin helper\nsnatched up his bedding and packed it away. Then she led Dura toward him.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Amid the silent urgency of the\ncompany, he mounted, then went with Foamfollower toward the center of the camp,\nwhere the Lords and Bloodguard were already mounted. When the warriors were\nready, Birinair extinguished the last embers of the fire, and climbed stiffly\nonto his horse. A moment later, the riders turned and fled the narrow valley,\npicking their way across the rough terrain by the last red light of the moon.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The ground under Dura's hooves\nlooked like blood slowly clotting, and Covenant clutched his ring to preserve\nit from the crimson light. Around him, the company moved in a tight suspense of\nsilence; every low, metal clatter of sword was instantly muffled, every breath\ncovered. The Ranyhyn were as noiseless as shadows, and on their broad backs the\nBloodguard sat like statues, eternally alert and insentient.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Then the moon set. Darkness was a\nrelief, though it seemed to increase the hazard of their escape. But the whole\ncompany was surrounded, guided, by the Ranyhyn, and the mighty horses chose a\npath which kept the other mounts safe between them.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>After two or three leagues had\npassed, the mood of the Quest relaxed somewhat. They heard no pursuit, sensed\nno danger. Finally Foamfollower gave Covenant the explanation he had promised.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;It is simple,&quot; the\nGiant whispered. &quot;After scattering the wolves, Korik and Terrel will lead\na trail away from ours. They will go straight into Andelain, east toward Mount\nThunder, until pursuit has been confused. Then they will turn and rejoin\nus.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Why?&quot; Covenant asked\nsoftly.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Lord Mhoram took up the\nexplanation. &quot;We doubt that Drool can understand our purpose.&quot;\nCovenant could not feel the Lord's presence as strongly as Foamfollower's, so\nMhoram's voice sounded disembodied in the darkness, as if the night were\nspeaking. That impression seemed to belie his words,</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>as if without the verification of\nphysical presence what the Lord said was vain. &quot;Much of our Quest may seem\nfoolhardy or foolish to him. Since he holds the Staff, we are mad to approach\nhim. But if we mean to approach nonetheless, then our southward path is folly,\nfor it is long, and his power grows-daily. He will expect us to turn east\ntoward him, or south toward Doom's Retreat and escape. Korik and Terrel will\ngive Drool's scouts reason to believe that we have turned to attack. If he\nbecomes unsure of where we are, he will not guess our true aim. He will search\nfor us in Andelain, and will seek to strengthen his defenses in Mount Thunder.\nBelieving that we have turned to attack him, he will also believe that we have\nmastered the power of your white gold.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant considered momentarily\nbefore asking, &quot;What's Foul going to be doing during all this?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Ah,&quot; Mhoram sighed,\n&quot;that is a question. There hangs the fate of our Quest-and of the\nLand.&quot; He was silent for a long time. &quot;In my dreams, I see him\nlaughing.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant winced at the memory of\nFoul's crushing laughter, and fell silent. So the riders crept on through the\ndark, trusting themselves to the instincts of the Ranyhyn. When dawn came, they\nhad left their ambush for the wolves far behind.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>It took the company four more days\nof hard riding, fifteen leagues a day, to reach the Mithil River, the southern\nboundary of Andelain. For sixty leagues, the Quest drove to the southeast\nwithout a hint of what had befallen Korik's group. In all, only eight people\nhad left the company. But somehow without them the Quest seemed shrunken and\npuny. The concern of the High Lord and his companions rumbled in the hoofbeats\nof their mounts, and echoed in the silence that lay between them like an empty\nbier.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Gone now was the gladness of eye\nwith which the warriors had beheld Andelain never more than a league to their\nleft. From dawn to dusk every glance studied the eastern horizons; they saw\nnothing but a void in which Korik's riders had not appeared. Time and again,\nFoamfollower broke away from the company to trot up the nearest hill and peer\ninto the distance; time and again, he returned panting and comfortless, and the\ncompany was left to conceive nightmares to explain Korik's absence.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The unspoken consensus was that no\nnumber of wolves was large enough to conquer two Bloodguard, mounted as they\nwere on Huryn and Brabha of the Ranyhyn. No, Korik's group must have fallen\ninto the hands of a small army of ur-viles so the company reasoned, though\nProthall argued that Korik might have had to ride many leagues to find a river\nor other means to throw the wolves off his trail. The High Lord's words were\nsound, but somehow under the incarnadine moon they seemed hollow. In spite of\nthem,</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Warhaft Quaan went 'about his\nduties with the deaths of six warriors in his face.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>All the riders were shrouded in\ngloom when, near twilight on the fourth day, they reached the banks of the\nMithil.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Immediately on their left as they\nneared the river stood a steep hill like a boundary of Andelain. It guarded the\nnorth bank; the company could only cross its base into Andelain by riding\nsingle file along the river edge. But Prothall chose that path in preference to\nswimming the stiff current of the Mithil. With only Tuvor before him, he led\nthe way east along the scant bank. The Questers followed one by one. Soon the\nentire company was traversing the boundary of the hill.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Spread out as they were, they were\nvulnerable. As the hill rose beside them, its slope became almost sheer, and\nits rocky crown commanded the path along the river like a fortification. The\nriders moved with their heads craned upward; they were keenly conscious of the\nhazard of their position.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>They were still in the traverse\nwhen they heard a hail from the hilltop. Among the rocks, a figure rose into\nview. It was Terrel.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The riders returned his hail\njoyfully. Hurrying, they crossed the base of the hill, and found themselves in\na broad, grassy valley where horses-two Ranyhyn and five mustangs-grazed up\naway from the river.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The mustangs were exhausted. Their\nlegs quivered weakly, and their necks drooped; they barely had strength enough\nto eat.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Five, Covenant repeated. He felt\nnumbly sure that he had miscounted.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Korik was on his way down from the\nhilltop. He was accompanied by five warriors.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>With an angry shout, Quaan leaped\nfrom his horse and ran toward the Bloodguard. &quot;Irin!&quot; he demanded.\n&quot;Where is Irin? By the Seven! What has happened to her?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Korik did not answer until he\nstood with his group before High Lord Prothall. They struck Covenant as a\nstrange combination: five warriors full of conflicting excitement, courage,\ngrief; and one Bloodguard as impassive as a patriarch. If Korik felt any\nsatisfaction or pain, he did not show it.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>He held a bulging pack in one\nhand, but did not refer to it. immediately. Instead, he saluted Prothall, and\nsaid, High Lord. You are well. Have you been pursued?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;We have seen no\npursuit,&quot; Prothall replied gravely.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;That is good. It appeared to\nus that we were successful.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Prothall nodded, and Korik began\nhis tale. &quot;We met the wolves and sought to scatter them. But they were\nkresh&quot;-he made a splitting sound&quot; not easily turned aside. So we led\nthem eastward. They would not enter Andelain. They howled on our track, but\nwould not enter. We watched from a distance until they turned away to the\nnorth. Then we rode east.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;After a day and a night, we\nbroke trail and turned south. But we came upon marauders. They were mightier\nthan we knew. There were ur-viles and Cavewights together, and with them a\ngriffin.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Korik's audience murmured with\nsurprise and chagrin, and the Bloodguard paused to utter what</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>sounded like a long curse in the\ntonal native tongue of-the Haruchai. Then he continued: &quot;Irin purchased\nour escape. But we were driven far from our way. We reached this place only a\nshort time before you.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>With a revolted flaring of his\nnostrils, he lifted the pack. &quot;This morning we saw a hawk over us. It flew\nstrangely. We shot it.&quot; Reaching into the pack, he drew out the body of\nthe bird. Above its vicious beak, it had only one eye, a large mad orb centered\nin its forehead.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>It struck the company with\nradiated malice. The hawk was ill, incondign, a thing created by wrong for\npurposes of wrong-bent away from its birth by a power that dared to warp\nnature. The sight stuck in Covenant's throat, made him want to retch. He could\nhardly hear Prothall say, &quot;This is the work of the Illearth Stone. How\ncould the Staff of Law perform such a crime, such an outrage? Ah, my friends,\nthis is the outcome of our enemy. Look closely. It is a mercy to take such\ncreatures out of life.&quot; Abruptly, the High Lord turned away, burdened by\nhis new knowledge.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Quaan and Birinair cremated the\nill-formed hawk. Soon the warriors who had gone with Korik began to talk, and a\nfuller picture of their past four days emerged. Attention naturally centered on\nthe fight which had killed Irin of the Eoman.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The Ranyhyn Brabha had first\nsmelled danger, and had given the warning to Korik. At once, he had hidden his\ngroup in a thick copse to await the coming of the marauders. Listening with his\near to the ground, he had judged that they were a mixed force of unmounted\nur-viles and Cavewights-Cavewights had not the ur-viles' ability to step softly\ntotaling no more than fifteen. So Korik had asked himself which way his service\nlay: to preserve his companions as defenders of the Lords, or to damage the\nLords' enemies. The Bloodguard were sworn to the protection of the Lords, not\nof the Land. He had elected to fight because he judged that his force was\nstrong enough, considering the element of surprise, to meet both duties without\nloss of life.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>His decision had saved them. They\nlearned later that if they had not attacked they would have been trapped in the\ncopse; the panic of the horses would have given away their hiding.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>It was a dark night after moonset,\nthe second night after Korik's group had left the company, and the marauders\nwere moving without lights. Even the Bloodguard's keen eyes discerned nothing\nmore than the shadowy outlines of the enemy. And the wind blew between the two\nforces, so that the Ranyhyn were prevented from smelling the extent of their\nperil.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>When the marauders reached open\nground, Korik signaled to his group; the warriors swept out of the copse behind\nhim and Terrel. The Ranyhyn outdistanced the others at once, so Korik and\nTerrel had just engaged the enemy when they heard the terror screams of the\nhorses. Wheeling around, the Bloodguard saw all six warriors struggling with\ntheir panicked steeds-and the griffin hovering over them. The griffin was a\nlion-like creature with sturdy wings that enabled it to fly for short\ndistances. It terrified the horses, swooped at the riders. Korik and Terrel\nraced toward their comrades. And behind them came the marauders.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The Bloodguard hurled- themselves\nat the griffin, but aloft, with its clawed feet downward, it had no vulnerable\nspots that they could reach without weapons. Then the marauders fell on the\ngroup. The warriors rallied to defend their horses. In the melee, Korik poised\nhimself on Brabha's back to spring up at the grin at the first opportunity. But\nwhen his chance came, Irin cut in front of him. Somehow, she had captured a long\nCavewightish broadsword. The griffin snatched her up in its claws, and as it\nripped her apart she beheaded it.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The next moment, another party of\nmarauders charged forward. The warriors' horses were too terrified</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>to' do anything but run. So\nKorik's group fled, dashed east and north with the enemy on their heels. By the\ntime they lost the pursuit, they had been driven so far into Andelain that they\nhad not been able to rejoin Prothall until the fourth day.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Early in the evening, the reunited\ncompany set up camp. While they prepared supper, a cool wind slowly mounted out\nof the north. At first it felt refreshing, full of Andelainian scents. But as\nmoonrise neared, it stiffened with a palpable wrench until it was scything\nstraight through the valley. Covenant could taste its unnaturalness; he had\nfelt something like it before. Like a whip, it drove dark cloudbanks southward.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>As the evening wore on, no one\nseemed inclined toward sleep. Depression deepened in the company as if the wind\nwere taut with dismay. On opposite sides of the camp, Foamfollower and Quaan\npaced out their uneasiness. Most of the warriors squatted around in dejected\nattitudes, fiddling aimlessly with their weapons. Birinair poked in unrelieved\ndissatisfaction at the fire. Prothall and Mhoram stood squarely in the wind as\nif they were trying to read it with the nerves of their faces. And Covenant sat\nwith his head bowed under a flurry of memories.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Only Variol and Tamarantha\nremained ungloomed. Arm in arm, the two ancient Lords sat and stared with a\ndreaming, drowsy look into the fire, and the firelight flickered like writing\non their foreheads.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Around the camp, the Bloodguard\nstood as stolid as stone.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Finally, Mhoram voiced the feeling\nof the company. &quot;Something happens-something dire. This is no natural\nwind.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Under the clouds, the eastern\nhorizon glowed red with moonlight. From time to time, Covenant thought be saw\nan orange flicker in the crimson, but he could not be sure. Covertly, he\nstudied his ring, and found the same occasional orange cast under the\ndominating blood. But he said nothing. He was too ashamed of Drool's hold on\nhim.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Still no storm came. The wind blew\non, rife with red mutterings and old ice, but it brought nothing but clouds and\ndiscouragement to the company. At last, most of the warriors dozed fitfully,\nshivering against the cut of the wind as it bore its harvest of distress toward\nDoom's Retreat and the Southron Wastes.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>There was no dawn; clouds choked\nthe rising sun. But the company was roused by a change in the wind. It dropped\nand warmed, swung-slowly toward the west. But it did not feel, healthier-only\nmore subtle. Several of the warriors rolled out of their blankets, clutching\ntheir swords.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The company ate in haste, impelled\nby the indefinite apprehension of the breeze. The old Hirebrand, Birinair, was\nthe first to understand. While chewing a mouthful of bread, he suddenly jerked\nerect as if he had been slapped. Quivering with concentration, he glowered at\nthe eastern horizon, then spat the bread to the ground. &quot;Burning!&quot; be\nhissed. &quot;The wind. I smell it. Burning. What? I can smell- Burning-a tree!\n&quot;A tree!&quot; he wailed. &quot;Ah, they dare!&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>For an instant, the company stared\nat him in silence. Then Mhoram ejaculated, &quot;Soaring Woodhelven is in\nflames!&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>His companions sprang into action.\nShrilly, the Bloodguard whistled for the Ranyhyn. Prothall snapped orders which\nQuaan echoed in a raw shout. Some of the warriors sprinted to saddle the\nhorses, while others broke camp. By the time Covenant was dressed and mounted\non Dura, the Quest was ready to</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>ride. At once, it galloped away\neastward along the Mithil. Before long, the horses began to give trouble. Even\nthe freshest ones could not keep pace with the Ranyhyn, and the mustangs which\nhad been with Korik in Andelain. had not recovered their strength. The terrain\ndid not allow for speed; it was too uneven. Prothall sent two Bloodguard ahead\nas scouts. But after that he was forced to move more slowly; he could not\nafford to leave part of his force behind. Still, he kept the pace as fast as\npossible. It was a frustrating ride-Covenant seemed to hear Quaan grinding his\nteeth-but it could not be helped. Grimly, Prothall held the fresher horses\nback.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>By noon, they reached the ford of\nthe Mithil. Now they could see smoke due south of them; and the smell of\nburning was powerful in the air. Prothall commanded a halt to water the horses.\nThen the riders pushed on, urging their weakest mounts to find somewhere new\nresources of strength and speed.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Within a few leagues, the High\nLord had to slow his pace still more; the scouts had not returned. The\npossibility that they had been ambushed clenched his brow, and his eyes\nglittered as if the orbs had facets of granite. He held the riders to a walk\nwhile he sent two more Bloodguard ahead.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>These two returned before the\ncompany had covered a league. They reported that Soaring Woodhelven was dead.\nThe area around it was deserted; signs indicated that the first two scouts had\nridden away to the south.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Muttering,\n&quot;Melenkurion!&quot; under his breath, Prothall led the riders forward at a\ncanter until they reached the remains of the tree village.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The destruction was a fiendish\npiece of work. Fire had reduced the original tree to smoldering spars less than\na hundred feet tall, and the charred trunk had been split from top to bottom,\nleaving the two halves leaning slightly away from each other. Occasional flames\nstill flickered near their tips. And all around the base of the tree, corpses\nlittered the ground as if the earth were already too full of dead to contain\nthe population of the village. Other Woodhelvennin bodies, unburned, were\nscattered generally in a line to the south across the glade.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Along this southward line, a few\ndead Cavewights sprawled in battle contortion. But near the tree there was only\none body which was not human--one dead ur-vile. It lay on its long back on the\nsouth of the tree, facing the split trunk; and its soot-black frame was as\ntwisted as the iron stave still clutched in its hands. Nearby lay a heavy iron\nplate nearly ten feet across.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The stench of dead, burned flesh\nappalled the surrounding glade. A memory of Woodhelvennin children writhed in\nCovenant's guts. He felt like vomiting.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The Lords seemed stupefied by the\nsight, stunned to realize that people under their care could be so murdered. After\na moment, First Mark Tuvor reconstructed the battle for them.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The folk of Soaring Woodhelven had\nnot had a chance.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Late the previous day, Tuvor\njudged, a large party of Cavewights and ur-viler-the trampling of the glade\nattested that the party was very large-had surrounded the tree. They had kept\nout of effective arrow range. Instead of assaulting the Woodhelvennin directly,\nthey sent a few of their number-almost certainly ur-viles forward under cover\nof the iron plate. Thus protected, the ur-viles set flame to the tree.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;A poor fire,&quot; Birinair\ninserted. Approaching the tree, he tapped it with his staff. A patch of\ncharcoal fell away, showing white wood underneath. &quot;Strong fire consumes\neverything,&quot; he muttered. &quot;Almost, they survived. This is good wood.\nMake the flame a little weaker-and the wood survives. Those who dared only\nstrong enough by a little. Numbers are nothing. Strength counts. Of course. A\nnarrow chance. Or if the Hirebrand had known. Been ready. He could have\nprepared the tree-given it strength. They could have lived. Ah! I should have\nbeen here. They would not do this to wood in my care.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Once the fire began, Tuvor\nexplained, the attackers simply shot arrows to prevent the flames from being\nput out-and waited for the desperate Woodhelvennin to attempt escape. Hence the\nline of unburned bodies running southward; that was the direction taken by the\nsortie. Then, when the fire was too great for the Woodhelvennin to resist\nfurther, the ur-vile loremaster split the tree to destroy it utterly, and to\nshake any survivors from its limbs.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Again Birinair spoke. &quot;He\nlearned. Retribution. The fool-not master of his own power. The tree struck him\ndown. Good wood. Even burning, it was not dead. The Hirebrand-a brave man.\nStruck back.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>And-and before the Desecration the\nlillianrill could have saved what life is left.&quot; He scowled as if he dared\nanyone to criticize him. &quot;No more. This I cannot.&quot; But a moment later\nhis imperiousness faded, and he turned sadly back to gaze on the ruined tree as\nif silently asking it to forgive him.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant did not question Tuvor's\nanalysis; he felt too sickened by the blood-thick reek around him. But\nFoamfollower did not seem affected in that way. Dully, he asserted, &quot;This\nis not Drool's doing. No Cavewight is the master of such strategy. Winds and\nclouds to disguise the signs of attack, should any help be near. Iron\nprotection carried here ,from who knows what distance. An attack with so little\nwaste of resource. No, the hand of Soulcrusher is here from first to last.\nStone and Sea!&quot; Without warning, his voice caught, and he turned away,\ngroaning his Giantish plainsong to steady himself.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Into the silence, Quaan asked,\n&quot;But why here?&quot; There was an edge like panic in his voice. &quot;Why\nattack this place?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Something in Quaan's tone, some\nhint of hysteria among brave but inexperienced, appalled young warriors, called\nProthall back from the wilderland where his thoughts wandered. Responding to\nQuaan's emotion rather than to his question, the High Lord said sternly,\n&quot;Warhaft Quaan, there is much work to be done. The horses will rest, but\nwe must work. Burial must be dug for the dead. After their last ordeal, it\nwould be unfitting to set them to the pyre. Put your Eoman to the task. Dig\ngraves in the south glade-there.&quot; He indicated a spread of grass about a\nhundred feet from the riven tree. &quot;We-&quot; he referred to his fellow\nLords. &quot;We will carry the dead to their graves.&quot; Foamfollower\ninterrupted his plainsong. &quot;No. I will carry. Let me show my\nrespect.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Very well,&quot; Prothall\nreplied. &quot;We will prepare food and consider our situation.&quot; With a\nnod, he sent Quaan to give orders to the Eoman. Then, turning to Tuvor, he\nasked that sentries be posted. Tuvor observed that eight Bloodguard were not\nenough to watch every possible approach to an open area as large as the glade,\nbut if he sent the Ranyhyn roaming separately around the bordering hills, he\nmight not need to call on the Eoman for assistance. After a momentary pause,\nthe First Mark asked what should be done about the missing scouts.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;We will wait,&quot; Prothall\nresponded heavily.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Tuvor nodded, and moved away to\ncommunicate with the Ranyhyn. They stood in a group nearby, looking with hot\neyes at the burned bodies around the tree. When Tuvor joined them, they\nclustered</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>about him as if eager to do whatever\nhe asked, and a moment later they charged out of the glade, scattering in all\ndirections.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The Lords dismounted, unpacked the\nsacks of food, and set about preparing a meal on a small lillianrill fire\nBirinair built for them. Warriors took all the horses upwind from the tree,\nunsaddled and tethered them. Then the Eoman went to begin digging.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Taking great care not to step on\nany of the dead, Foamfollower moved toward the tree, reached the iron plate. It\nwas immensely heavy, but he lifted it and carried it beyond the ring of bodies.\nThere he began gently placing corpses on the plate, using it as a sled to move\nthe bodies to their graves. Knots of emotion jumped and bunched across his\nbuttressed forehead, and his eyes flared with a dangerous enthusiasm.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>For a while, Covenant was the only\nmember of the company without an assigned task. The fact disturbed him. The\nstench of the dead-Baradakas included somewhere among them, he thought\nachingly, Baradakas and Llaura and children, children!-made him remember Soaring\nWoodhelven as he had left it days ago: tall and proud, lush with the life of a\nfair people.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>He needed something to do to\ndefend himself.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>As he scanned the company, he\nnoticed that the warriors lacked digging tools. They had brought few picks and\nshovels with them; most of them were trying to dig with their hands or their\nswords. He walked over to the tree. Scattered around the trunk were many burned\nbranches, some of them still solid in the core. Though he had to pick his way\namong the dead-though the close sight of all that flesh smeared like moldering\nwax over charred bones hurt his guts -he gathered branches that he could not\nbreak across his knee. These he carried away from the tree, then used his\nStonedownor knife to scrape them clean and cut them into stakes. The work\nblackened his hands, his white robe, and the knife twisted awkwardly in his\nhalf-fingered grip, but he persisted.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The stakes he gave to the\nwarriors, and with them they were able to dig faster. Instead of individual\ngraves, they dug trenches, each deep and long enough to hold a dozen or more of\nthe dead. Using Covenant's stakes, the warriors began to finish their graves\nfaster than Foamfollower could fill them.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Late in the afternoon, Prothall\ncalled the company to eat. By that time, nearly half the bodies had been\nburied. No one felt like consuming food with their lungs full of acrid air and\ntheir eyes sore of-,tormented flesh, but the High Lord insisted. Covenant found\nthis strange until he tasted the food. The Lords had prepared a stew unlike\nanything he had eaten in the Land. Its savor quickened his hunger, and when he\nswallowed it, it soothed his distress. It was the first meal he had had since\nthe previous day, and he surprised himself by eating ravenously.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Most of the warriors were done\neating, and the sun was about to set, when their attention was snatched erect\nby a distant hail. The southmost sentry answered, and a moment later the two\nmissing Bloodguard came galloping into the glade. Their Ranyhyn were soaked\nwith sweat.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>They brought two people with them:\na woman, and a boy-child the size of a four-year-old, both Woodhelvennin, both\nmarked as if they had survived a battle.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The tale of the scouts was quickly\ntold. They had reached the deserted glade, and had found the southward trail of\nthe Woodhelvennin's attempted escape. And they had seen some evidence that all\nthe people might not have been killed. Since the enemy had gone-so there was no\ncompelling need to ride back to warn the Lords-they had decided to search for\nsurvivors. They had erased the signs, so that any</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>returning marauders might not find\nthem, and had ridden south.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Early in the afternoon, they found\nthe woman and child fleeing madly without thought or caution. Both appeared\ninjured; the child gave no sign of awareness at all, and the woman vacillated\nbetween lucidity and incoherence. She accepted the Bloodguard as friends, but\nwas unable to tell them anything.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>However, in a lucid moment, she\ninsisted that an Unfettered Healer lived a league or two away. Hoping to gain knowledge\nfrom the woman, the scouts took her to the cave of the Healer. But the cave was\nempty -and appeared to have been empty, for many days. So the scouts brought\nthe two survivors back to Soaring Woodhelven.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The two stood before the Lords,\nthe woman clutching the child's unresponsive hand. The boy gazed incuriously\nabout him, but did not notice faces or react to voices. When his hand slipped\nfrom the woman's, his arm fell limply to his side; he neither resisted nor\ncomplied when she snatched it up again. His unfocused eyes seemed\npreternaturally dark, as if they were full of black blood.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The sight of him jabbed Covenant.\nThe boy could have been the future of his own son, Roger-the son of whom he had\nbeen dispossessed, reft as if even his fatherhood had been abrogated by\nleprosy. Children! Foul? he panted. Children?</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>As if in oblique answer to his\nthoughts, the woman suddenly said, &quot;He is Pietten son of Soranal. He likes\nthe horses.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;It is true,&quot; one of the\nscouts responded. &quot;He rode before me and stroked the Ranyhyn's neck.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>But Covenant was not listening. He\nwas looking at the woman. Confusedly, he sorted through the battle wreckage of\nher face, the cuts and burns and grime and bruises. Then he said hesitantly,\n&quot;Llaura?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The sun was setting, but there was\nno sunset. Clouds blanked the horizon, and a short twilight was turning rapidly\ninto night. But as the sun fell, the air became thicker and more sultry, as if\nthe darkness were sweating in apprehension.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Yes, I know you,&quot; the\nwoman said in a flagellated voice. &quot;You are Thomas Covenant, Unbeliever\nand white gold wielder. In the semblance of Berek Halfhand. Jehannum spoke\ntruth. Great evil has come.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>She articulated with extreme care,\nas if she were trying to balance her words on the edge of a sword. &quot;I am Llaura\ndaughter of Annamar, of the Heers of Soaring Woodhelven. Our scouts must have\nbeen slain. We had no warning. Be-&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>But as she tried to say the words,\nher balance failed, and she collapsed into a hoarse, repeating moan-&quot;Uhn,\nuhn, uhn, uhn&quot;-as if the connection between her brain and her throat\nbroke, leaving her struggling frantically with her inability to speak. Her eyes\nburned with furious concentration, and her head shook as she tried to form\nwords. But nothing came between her juddering lips except, &quot;Uhn, uhn,\nuhn.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The Bloodguard scout said,\n&quot;So she was when we found her. At one moment, she can speak. A moment\nlater, she cannot.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Hearing this, Llaura clenched\nherself violently and pushed down her hysteria, rejecting what the scout said.\n&quot;I am Llaura,&quot; she repeated, &quot;Llaura- of the Heers of Soaring\nWoodhelven. Our scouts must have been slain. I am Llaura, I am Llaura,&quot;\nshe insisted. &quot;Beware-&quot; Again her voice broke into moaning,\n&quot;Uhn, uhn.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Her panic mounted. &quot;Be-uhn,\nuhn, uhn. Be- uhn, uhn. I am Llaura. You are the Lords. You must 1-uhn,</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>uhn. Ambuhn, uhn, uhn.&quot; As\nshe fought, Covenant glanced around the company. Everyone was staring intently\nat Llaura, and Variol and Tamarantha had tears in their eyes. &quot;Somebody do\nsomething,&quot; he muttered painfully. &quot;Somebody.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Abruptly, Llaura seemed to\ncollapse. Clutching her throat with her free hand, she shrieked, &quot;You must\nhear me!&quot; and started to fall.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>As. her knees gave way, Prothall\nstepped forward and caught her. With fierce strength, he gripped her upper arms\nand held her erect before him. &quot;Stop,&quot; he commanded. &quot;Stop. Do\nnot speak anymore. Listen, and use your head to answer me.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>A look of hope flared across\nLlaura's eyes, and she relaxed until Prothall set her on her feet. Then she\nregained the child's hand.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Now,&quot; the High Lord\nsaid levelly, staring deep into her ravaged eyes. &quot;You are not mad. Your\nmind is clear. Something has been done to you.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Llaura nodded eagerly, Yes.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;When your people attempted\nto escape, you were captured.&quot; She nodded, Yes.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;You and the child.&quot;\nYes.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;And something was done to\nhim as well?&quot; Yes.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Do you know what it\nwas?&quot; She shook her head, No.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Was the same done to you\nboth?&quot; No.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Well,&quot; Prothall sighed.\n&quot;Both were captured instead of slain. And the ur-vile loremaster afflicted\nyou.&quot; Llaura nodded, Yes, shuddering.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Damaged you.&quot; Yes.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Caused the difficulty that\nyou now have when you speak.&quot; Yes!</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Now your ability to speak\ncomes and goes.&quot; No!</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;No?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Prothall paused to consider for a\nmoment, and Covenant interjected, &quot;Hellfire! Get her to write it\ndown.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Llaura shook her head, raised her\nfree hand. It trembled uncontrollably. Abruptly, Prothall said, &quot;Then\nthere are certain things that you cannot say.&quot; Yes!</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;There is something that the\nattackers do not wish you to speak.&quot; Yes!</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Then-&quot; The High Lord\nhesitated as if he could hardly believe his thoughts. &quot;Then the attackers\nknew that you would be found-by us or others who came too late to the aid of\nSoaring Woodhelven.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Yes!</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Therefore you fled south,\ntoward Banyan Woodhelven and the Southron Stonedowns.&quot; She nodded, but her\nmanner seemed to indicate that he had missed the point.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Observing her, he muttered,\n&quot;By the Seven! This cannot do. Such questioning requires time, and my\nheart tells me we have little. What has been done to the boy? How could the\nattackers know that we -or anyone- would come this way? What knowledge could\nshe have? Knowledge that an ur-vile loremaster would fear to have told? No, we\nmust find other means.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>At the edge of his sight, Covenant\nsaw Variol and Tamarantha setting out their blankets near the campfire. Their\naction startled him away from Llaura for a moment. Their eyes held a sad and\ncuriously secret look. He could not fathom it, but for some reason it reminded\nhim that they had known what Prothall's decision for the Quest would lie before\nthat decision was made.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;High Lord,&quot; said\nBirinair stiffly.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Concentrating on Llaura, Prothall\nreplied, &quot;Yes?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;That young whelp of a\nGravelingas, Tohrm, gave me a rhadhamaerl gift. I almost thought he mocked me.\nLaughed because I am not a puppy like himself. It was hurtloam.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Hurtloam?&quot; Prothall\nechoed in surprise. &quot;You have some?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Have it? Of course. No fool,\nyou know. I keep' it moist. Tohrm tried to teach me. As if I knew\nnothing.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Mastering his impatience, Prothall\nsaid, &quot;Please bring it.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>A moment later, Birinair handed to\nthe High Lord a small stoneware pot full of the damp, glittering clay\n-hurtloam. &quot;Watch out,&quot; Covenant murmured with complex memories in\nhis voice, &quot;it'll put her to sleep.&quot; But Prothall did not hesitate.\nIn darkness lit only by Birinair's lillianrill fire and the last coals of the\nriven tree, he scooped out some of the hurtloam. Its golden flecks caught the\nfirelight and gleamed. Tenderly, he spread the mud across Llaura's forehead,\ncheeks, and throat.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant was marginally aware that\nLord Mhoram no longer attended Prothall and Llaura. He had joined Variol and\nTamarantha, and appeared to be arguing with them. They lay side by side on\ntheir backs, holding hands, and he stood over them as if he were trying to ward\noff a shadow. But they were unmoved. Through his protests, Tamarantha said\nsoftly, &quot;It is better thus, my son.&quot; And Variol murmured, &quot;Poor\nLlaura. This is all we can do.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant snapped a look around the\ncompany. The warriors seemed entranced by the questioning of the Heer, but\nFoamfollower's cavernous eyes flicked without specific focus over the glade as\nif they were weaving dangerous visions. Covenant turned back toward Llaura with\nan ominous chill scrabbling along his spine.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The first touch of the hurtloam\nonly multiplied her distress. Her face tightened in torment, and a rictus like\na foretaste of death stretched her lips into a soundless scream. But then a\nharsh convulsion shook her, and the crisis passed. She fell to her knees and\nwept with relief as if a knife had been removed from her mind.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Prothall knelt beside her\nancdlasped her in the solace of his arms, waiting without a word for her\nself-control to return. She needed a moment to put aside her weeping. Then she\nsnatched herself up, crying, &quot;Flee! You must flee! This is an ambush! You\nare trapped!&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>But her warning came too late. At\nthe same moment, Tuvor returned from his lookout at a run, followed almost at\nonce by the other Bloodguard &quot; &quot;Prepare for attack,&quot; the First\nMark said flatly. &quot;We are surrounded. The Ranyhyn were cut off, and could\nnot warn us. There will be battle. We have only time to prepare.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant could not grasp the\nimmediacy of what he heard. Prothall barked orders; the camp began to clear.\nWarriors and Bloodguard dove into the still empty trenches, hid themselves in\nthe hollow base of the tree. &quot;Leave the horses,&quot; Tuvor commanded.\n&quot;The Ranyhyn will break through to protect them if it is possible.&quot;\nProthall consigned Llaura and the child to Foamfollower, who placed them alone\nin a grave and covered them with the iron plate. Then Prothall and Mhoram\njumped together into the southmost trench. But Covenant stood where he was.\nVaguely, he watched Birinair reduce the campfire to its barest embers, then\nposition himself against the burned trunk of the tree. Covenant needed time to\ncomprehend what had been done to Llaura. Her plight numbed him.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>First she had been given knowledge\nwhich might have saved the Lords-and then she had been made unable to\ncommunicate that knowledge. And her struggles to give the warning only ensured\nher failure by guaranteeing that the Lords would attempt to understand her\nrather than ride away. Yet what had been done to her was unnecessary,\ngratuitous; the trap would have succeeded without it. In every facet of her\nmisery, Covenant could hear Lord Foul laughing.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Bannor's touch on his shoulder\njarred him. The Bloodguard said as evenly as if he were announcing the time of\nday, &quot;Come, ur-Lord. You must conceal yourself. It is necessary.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Necessary? Silently, Covenant\nbegan to shout, Do you know what he did to her?</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>But when he turned, he saw Variol\nand Tamarantha still lying by the last embers of the fire, protected by only\ntwo Bloodguard. What-? he gaped. They'll be killed!</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>At the same time, another part of\nhis brain insisted, He's doing the same thing to me. Exactly the same thing. To\nBannor he groaned, &quot;Don't touch me. Hellfire and bloody damnation. Aren't\nyou ever going to learn?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Without hesitation, Bannor lifted\nCovenant, swung him around, and dropped him into one of the trenches. There was\nhardly room for him; Foamfollower filled the rest of the grave, squatting to\nkeep his head down. But Bannor squeezed into the trench after Covenant,\npositioned himself with his arms free over the Unbeliever.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Then a silence full of the aches\nand quavers of fear fell over the camp. At last, the apprehension of the attack\ncaught up with Covenant. His heart lurched; sweat bled from his forehead; his\nnerves shrilled as if they had been laid bare. A gray nausea that filled his throat\nlike dirt almost made him gag. He tried to swallow -it away, and could not. No!\nhe panted. Not like this. I will not!</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Exactly the same, exactly what\nhappened to Llaura.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>A hungry shriek ripped the air.\nAfter it came the tramp of approach. Covenant risked a glance over the rim of\nthe grave, and saw the glade surrounded by black forms and hot laval eyes. They\nmoved slowly, giving the encamped figures a chance to taste their own end. And\nflapping heavily overhead just behind the advancing line was the dark shape of\na beast.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant recoiled. In fear, he\nwatched the attack like an outcast, from a distance.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>As the Cavewights and ur-viles\ncontracted their ring around the glad centered their attack on the helpless\ncampsite the wall of them thickened, reducing at every step the chance that the\ncompany might be able to break through their ranks. Slowly their approach\nbecame louder; they stamped the ground as if they were trying to crush the\ngrass. And a low wind of mutterings became audible-soft snarls, hissings through\nclenched teeth, gurgling, gleeful salivations -blew over the graves like an\nexhalation littered with the wreckage of mangled lives. The Cavewights gasped\nlike lunatics tortured into a love of killing; the nasal sensing of the\nur-viles sibilated wetly. And behind the other sounds, terrible in their\nquietness, came the wings of a grin, drumming a dirge.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The tethered horses began to\nscream. The stark terror of the sound pulled Covenant up, and he looked long\nenough to see that the mustangs were not harmed. The tightening ring parted to\nbypass them, and a few Cavewights dropped from the attack to unfetter them,\nlead them away. The horses fought hysterically, but the strength of the\nCavewights mastered them.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Then the attackers were less than\na hundred feet from the graves. Covenant cowered down as far as he could. He\nhardly dared to breathe. The whole company was helpless in the trenches.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The next, moment, a howl went up\namong the attackers. Several Cavewights cried, &quot;Only five?&quot; &quot;All\nthose horses?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Cheated!&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>In rage at the puny number of\ntheir prey, nearly a third of them broke ranks and charged the campfire.\nInstantly, the company seized its chance.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The Ranyhyn whinnied. Their\ncombined call throbbed in the air like the shout of trumpets. Together they thundered\nout of the east toward the captured horses.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Birinair stepped away from the\nriven tree. With a full swing of his staff and a cry, he struck the burned\nwood. The tree erupted in flames, threw dazzling light at the attackers.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Prothall and Mhoram sprang\ntogether from the southmost trench. Their staffs flared with blue Lordsfire.\nCrying, &quot;Melenkurion!&quot; they drove their power against the creatures.\nThe nearest Cavewights and ur-viles retreated in fear from the flames.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Warriors and Bloodguard leaped out\nof the graves, sprinted from the hollow of the tree.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>And behind them -came the towering\nform of Saltheart Foamfollower, shouting a rare Giantish war call. With cries\nof fear and rage, fire, swift blows and clashing weapons, the battle began.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The company was outnumbered ten to\none.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Jerking his gaze from scene to\nscene, Covenant saw how the fighting commenced. The Bloodguard deployed\nthemselves instantly, two to defend each Lord, with one standing by Birinair\nand another, Bannor, warding the trench where Covenant stood. The warriors\nrapidly formed groups of five. Guarding each other's backs, they strove to cut\ntheir way in and out of the line of the attackers. Mhoram charged around the\nfight, trying to find the commanders or loremasters of the enemy. Prothall stood\nin the center of the battle to give the company a rallying point. He shouted\nwarnings and orders about him.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>But Foamfollower fought alone. He\nrampaged through the attack like a berserker, pounding with his fists, kicking,\nthrowing anything within reach. His war call turned into one long, piercing\nsnarl of fury; his huge strides kept him in the thick of the fighting. At\nfirst, he looked powerful enough to handle the entire host alone. But soon the\ngreat strength of the Cavewights made itself felt. They jumped at him in\nbunches; four of them were able to bring him down. He was up again in an\ninstant, flinging bodies about him like dolls. But it was clear that, if enough\nCavewights attacked him together, he would be lost.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Variol and Tamarantha were in no-\nless danger. They lay motionless under the onslaught, and their four Bloodguard\nstrove extravagantly to preserve them. Some of the attackers risked arrows; the\nBloodguard knocked the shafts aside with the backs of their hands. Spears\nfollowed, and then the Cavewights charged with swords and staves. Weaponless\nand unaided, the Bloodguard fought back with speed, balance, skill, with\nperfectly placed kicks and blows. They seemed impossibly successful. Soon a\nsmall ring of dead and unconscious Cavewights encircled the two Lords. But like\nFoamfollower they were vulnerable, would have to be vulnerable, to a concerted\nassault.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>At Prothall's order, one group of\nwarriors moved to help the four Bloodguard. Covenant looked away.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>He found Mhoram waging a weird\ncontest with thirty or forty ur-viles. All the ur-viles in the attack they were\nfew in proportion to the Cavewights-had formed a fighting wedge behind their\ntallest member, their</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>loremaster-a wedge which allowed\nthem to focus their whole power in the leader. The loremaster wielded a\nscimitar with a flaming blade, and against it Mhoram opposed his fiery staff.\nThe clashing of power showered hot sparks that dazzled and singed the air.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Then a swirl of battle swept\ntoward Covenant's trench. Figures leaped over him; Bannor fought like a dervish\nto ward off spears. A moment later, a warrior came to his aid. She was the\nWoodhelvennin who had assigned herself to Covenant. She and Bannor struggled to\nkeep him alive.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>He clutched his hands to his chest\nas if to protect his ring. His fingers unconsciously took hold of the metal.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Through the dark flash of legs, he\ncaught a glimpse of Prothall, saw that the High Lord was under attack. Using\nhis blazing staff like a lance, he strove with the griffin. The beast's wings\nalmost buffeted him from his feet, but he kept his position and jabbed his blue\nfire upward. But astride the griffin sat another ur-vile loremaster. The\ncreature used a black stave to block the High Lord's thrusts.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>As Covenant watched, the\ndesperation of the conflict mounted. Figures fell and rose and fell again.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Blood spattered down on him.\nAcross the glade, Foamfollower heaved to his feet from under a horde of\nCavewights, and was instantly, deluged. Prothall fell to one knee under the\ncombined force of his assailants. The ur-vile wedge drove Mhoram steadily\nbackward; the two Bloodguard with him were hard pressed to protect his back.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant's throat felt choked with\nsand.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Already, two warriors had fallen\namong the Cavewights around Variol and Tamarantha. At one instant, a Bloodguard\nfound himself, and Tamarantha behind him, attacked simultaneously by three\nCavewights with spears. The Bloodguard broke the first spear with a chop of his\nhand, and leaped high over the second to kick its wielder in the face. But even\nhis great speed was not swift enough. The third Cavewight caught him by the\narm. Grappling at once, the first latched his long fingers onto the\nBloodguard's ankle. The two stretched their captive between them, and their\ncompanion jabbed his spear at the Bloodguard's belly.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant watched, transfixed with\nhelplessness, as the Bloodguard strained against the Cavewights,</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>pulled them close enough together\nto wrench himself out of the path of the spear. Its tip scored his back. The\nnext instant, he groined both his captors. They dropped him, staggered back. He\nhit the ground and rolled. But the middle Cavewight caught him with a kick so\nhard that it flung him away from Tamarantha.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Yelling his triumph, the Cavewight\nlunged forward with his spear raised high in both hands to impale the recumbent\nLord.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Tamarantha!</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Her peril overwhelmed Covenant's\nfear. Without thinking, he vaulted from the safety of his trench and started\ntoward her. She was so old and frail that he could not restrain himself.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The Woodhelvennin yelled, &quot;Down!&quot;\nHis sudden appearance aboveground distracted her, gave her opponents a target.\nAs a result, she missed a parry, and a sword thrust opened her side. But\nCovenant did not see her. He was already running toward Tamarantha-and already\ntoo late.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The Cavewight drove his spear\ndownward.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>At the last instant, the\nBloodguard saved Tamarantha by diving across her and catching the spear in his\nown back.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant hurled himself at the\nCavewight and tried to stab it with his stone knife. The blade twisted in his\nhalfhand; he only managed to scratch the creature's shoulder blade.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The knife fell from his wrenched\nfingers.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The Cavewight whirled and struck\nhim to the ground with a slap. The blow stunned him for a moment, but Bannor\nrescued him by attacking the creature. The Cavewight countered as if elevated,\ninspired, by his success against the dead Bloodguard. He shrugged off Bannor's\nblows, caught him in his long strong arms and began to squeeze. Bannor struck\nat the Cavewight's ears and eyes, but the maddened creature only tightened his\ngrip.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Inchoate rage roared in Covenant's\nears. Still half dazed, he stumbled toward Tamarantha's still form and snatched\nher staff from her side. She made no movement, and he asked no permission.\nTurning, he wheeled the staff wildly about his head and brought it down with\nall his strength on the back of the Cavewight's skull.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>White and crimson power flashed in\na silent explosion. The Cavewight fell instantly dead.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The ignition blinded Covenant for\na moment. But he recognized the sick red hue of the flare. As his eyes cleared,\nhe gaped at his hands, at his ring. He could not remember having removed it\nfrom the clingor on his chest. But it hung on his wedding finger and throbbed\nredly under the influence of the cloudlocked moon.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Another Cavewight loomed out of\nthe battle at him. Instinctively, he hacked with the staff at the creature. It\ncollapsed in a bright flash that was entirely crimson.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>At the sight, his old fury\nerupted. His mind went blank with violence. Howling, &quot;Foul!&quot; as if\nthe Despiser were there before him, he charged into the thick of the fray.\nFlailing about him like madness, he struck down another Cavewight, and another,\nand another. But he did not watch where he was going. After the third blow he\nfell into one of the trenches. Then for a long time he lay in the grave like a\ndead man. Whe he finally climbed to his feet, he was trembling with revulsion.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Above him, the battle burned\nfeverishly. He could not judge how many of the attackers had been killed or\ndisabled. But some turning point had been reached; the company had changed its\ntactics. Prothall fled from the griffin to Foamfollower's aid. And when the\nGiant regained his feet, he turned, dripping blood, to fight the griffin while\nProthall joined Mhoram against the ur-viles. Bannor held himself over Covenant;\nbut Quaan marshaled the survivors of his Eoman to make a stand around Variol\nand Tamarantha.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>A moment later, the Ranyhyn gave a\nringing call. Having freed the horses, they charged into the battle. And as\ntheir hooves and teeth crashed among the Cavewights, Prothall and Mhoram\ntogether swung their flaming staffs to block the loremaster's downstroke. Its\nhot scimitar shattered into fragments of lava, and the backlash of power felled\nthe ur-vile itself. Instantly, the creatures shifted their wedge to present a\nnew leader. But their strongest had fallen, and they began to give way.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>On the other side of the battle,\nFoamfollower caught the griffin by surprise. The beast was harrying the\nwarriors around Variol and Tamarantha. With a roar, Foamfollower sprang into\nthe air and wrapped his arms in a death hug around the body of the griffin. His\nweight bore it to the ground; they rolled and struggled on the blood-slick\ngrass. The riding ur-vile was thrown off, and Quaan beheaded it before it</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>could raise its stave.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The griffin yowled hideously with\nrage and pain, tried to twist in Foamfollower's grip to reach him with its\nclaws and fangs. But he squeezed it with all his might, silently braced himself\nagainst its thrashings and strove to kill it before it was able to turn and\nrend him.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>For the most part, he succeeded.\nHe exerted a furious jerk of pressure, and heard bones retort' loudly in the\nbeast's back. The griffin spat a final scream, and died. For a moment, he\nrested beside its body, panting hoarsely. Then he lumbered to his feet. His\nforehead had been clawed open to the bone.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>But he did not stop. Dashing blood\nfrom his eyes, he ran and threw himself full-length onto the tight wedge of the\nurviles. Their formation crumbled under the impact.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>At once, the ur-viles chose to\nflee. Before Foamfollower could get to his feet, they were gone, vanished into\nthe darkness.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Their defection seemed to drain\nthe Cavewights' mad courage. The gangrel creatures were no longer able to brave\nthe Lords-fire. Panic spread among them from the brandished staffs,\nflash-firing in the sudden tinder of their hearts.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>A cry of failure broke through the\nattack. The Cavewights began to run.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Howling their dismay, they\nscattered away from the blazing tree. They ran with grotesque jerkings of their\nknuckled joints, but their strength and length of limb gave them speed. In\nmoments, the last of them had fled the glade.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Foamfollower charged after them.\nYelling Giantish curses, he chased the fleers as if he meant to crush them all\nunderfoot. Swiftly, he disappeared into the darkness, and soon he could no\nlonger be heard. But from time to time there came faint screams through the\nnight, as he caught escaping Cavewights.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Tuvor asked Prothall if some of\nthe Bloodguard should join Foamfollower, but the High Lord shook his head.\n&quot;We have done enough,&quot; he panted. &quot;Remember the Oath of\nPeace.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>For a time of exhaustion and\nrelief, the company stood in silence underscored by the gasp of their breathing\nand the groans of the disabled Cavewights. No one moved; to Covenant's ears,\nthe silence sounded like a prayer. Unsteadily, he pulled himself out of the\ntrench. Looking about him with glazed eyes, he took the toll of the battle.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Cavewights sprawled around the\ncamp in twisted heaps-nearly a hundred of them, dead, dying, and\nunconscious-and their blood lay everywhere like a dew of death. There were ten\nur-viles dead. Five warriors would not ride again with their Eoman, and none of\nQuaan's command had escaped injury. But of the Bloodguard only one had fallen.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>With a groan that belied his\nwords, High Lord Prothall said, &quot;We are fortunate.&quot;\n&quot;Fortunate?&quot; Covenant echoed in vague disbelief.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;We are fortunate.&quot; An\naccent of anger emphasized the old rheumy rattle of Prothall's voice.\n&quot;Consider that we might all have died. Consider such an attack during the\nfull of the moon. Consider that while Drool's thoughts are turned here, he is\nnot multiplying defenses in Mount Thunder. We have paid his voice choked for a\nmoment &quot;paid but little for our lives and hope.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant did not reply for a\nmoment. Images of violence dizzied him. All the Woodhelvennin were\ndead-Cavewights-urviles-the warrior who had chosen to watch over him. He did\nnot even know her name. Foamfollower had killed-he himself had killed five-five.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>He was trembling, but he needed to\nspeak, needed to defend himself. He was sick with horror. &quot;Foamfollower's\nright,&quot; he rasped hoarsely. &quot;This is Foul's doing.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>No one appeared to hear him. The\nBloodguard went to the Ranyhyn and brought their - fallen comrade's mount close\nto the fire. Lifting the man gently, they set him on the Ranyhyn's back and\nbound him in place with clingor thongs. Then together they gave a silent\nsalute, and the Ranyhyn galloped away, bearing its dead rider toward the\nWestron Mountains and Guards Gap-home.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Foul planned the whole\nthing.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>When the Ranyhyn had vanished into\nthe night, some of the Bloodguard tended the injuries of their mounts, while\nothers resumed their sentry duty.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Meanwhile, the warriors began\nmoving among the Cavewights, finding the living among the dead. All that were\nnot mortally wounded were dragged to their feet and chased away from the camp.\nThe rest were piled on the north side of the tree for a pyre.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;It means two things.&quot;\nCovenant strove to master the quaver in his voice. &quot;It's the same thing\nthat he's doing to me. It's a lesson-like what happened to Llaura. Foul is\ntelling us what he's doing to us because he's sure that knowing won't help. He\nwants to milk us for all the despair we're worth.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>With the aid of two warriors,\nProthall released Llaura and Pietten from their tomb. Llaura looked exhausted\nto the limit; she was practically prostrate on her feet. But little Pietten ran\nhis hands over the blood-wet grass, then licked his fingers.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant turned away with a groan.\n&quot;The other thing is that Foul really wants us to get at Drool. To die or\nnot. He tricked Drool into this attack so that he wouldn't be busy defending\nhimself. So Foul must know what we're doing, even if Drool doesn't.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Prothall seemed troubled by the\noccasional distant screams, but Mhoram did not notice them. While the rest of\nthe company set about their tasks, the Lord went and knelt beside Variol and\nTamarantha. He bent over his parents, and under his red-stained robe his body\nwas rigid.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;I tell you, this is all part\nof Foul's plan. Hellfire! Aren't you listening to me?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Abruptly, Mhoram stood and faced\nCovenant. He moved as if he were about to hurl a curse at Covenant's head. But\nhis eyes bled with tears, and his voice wept as he said, &quot;They are dead.\nVariol and Tamarantha my parents-father and mother of me, body and soul.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant could see the hue of\ndeath on their old skin.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;It cannot be!&quot; one of\nthe warriors cried. &quot;I saw. No weapon touched them. They were kept by the\nBloodguard.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Prothall hastened to examine the\ntwo Lords. He touched their hearts and heads, then sagged and</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>sighed, &quot;Nevertheless.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Both Variol and Tamarantha were\nsmiling.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The warriors stopped what they\nwere doing; in silence, the Eoman put aside its own fatigue and grief to stand\nbowed in respect before Mhoram and his dead. Stooping, Mhoram lifted both\nVariol and Tamarantha in his arms. Their thin bones were light in his embrace,\nas if they had lost the weight of mortality. On his cheeks, tears gleamed\norangely, but his shoulders were steady, un-sob-shaken, to uphold his parents.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant's mind was beclouded. He\nwandered in mist, and his words were wind-torn from him. &quot;Do you mean to\ntell me that we-that I-we-? For a couple of corpses?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Mhoram showed no sign of having heard.\nBut a scowl passed like a spasm across Prothall's face, and Quaan stepped to\nthe Unbeliever's side at once, gripped his elbow, whispered into his ear,\n&quot;If you speak again, I will break your arm.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Don't touch me,&quot;\nCovenant returned. But his voice was forceless. He submitted, swirling in lost\nfog. , Around him, the company took on an attitude of ritual. Leaving his staff\nwith one of the warriors, High Lord Prothall retrieved the staffs of the dead\nLords and held them like an offering across his arms. And Mhoram turned toward\nthe blaze of the tree with Variol and Tamarantha clasped erect in his embrace.\nThe silence quivered painfully. After a long moment, he began to sing. His\nrough song sighed like a river, and he sang hardly louder than the flow of water\nbetween quiet banks.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Death reaps the beauty of the\nworld- bundles old crops to hasten new.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Be still, heart:</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>hold peace.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Growing is better than decay:</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>I hear the blade which severs life\nfrom life. Be still, peace:</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>hold heart.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Death is passing on- the making\nway of life and time for life. Hate dying and killing, not death.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Be still, heart:</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>make no expostulation.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Hold peace and grief and be still.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>As he finished, his shoulders\nlurched as if unable to bear their burden without giving at least one sob to\nthe dead. &quot;Ah, Creator!&quot; he cried in a voice full of bereavement.\n&quot;How can I honor them? I am stricken at heart, and consumed with the work\nthat I must do. You must honor them-for they have honored you.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>At the edge of the firelight, the\nRanyhyn Hynaril gave a whinny like a cry of grief. The great roan mare reared\nand pawed the air with her forelegs, then whirled and galloped away eastward.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Then Mhoram murmured again, Be\nstill, heart:</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>make no expostulation. Hold peace\nand grief and be still.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Gently, he laid Variol on the\ngrass and lifted Tamarantha in both arms. Calling hoarsely, &quot;Hail!&quot;\nhe placed her into the cleft of the burning tree. And before the flames could\nblacken her age-etched skin, he lifted Variol and set him beside her, calling\nagain, &quot;Hail!&quot; Their shared smile could be seen for a moment before\nthe blaze obscured it. So they lay together in consummation.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Already dead, Covenant groaned.\nThat Bloodguard was killed. Oh, Mhoram! In his confusion, he could not\ndistinguish between grief and anger.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>His eyes now dry, Mhoram turned to\nthe company, and his gaze seemed to focus on Covenant. &quot;My friends, be\nstill at heart,&quot; he said comfortingly. &quot;Hold peace for all your\ngrief. Variol and Tamarantha are ended. Who could deny them? They knew the time\nof their death. They read the close of their lives in the ashes of Soaring\nWoodhelven, and were glad to serve us with their last sleep. They chose to draw\nthe attack upon themselves so that we might live. Who will say that the\nchallenge which they met was not great? Remember the Oath, and hold\nPeace.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Together, the Eoman made the\nheart-opening salute of farewell, arms spread wide as if uncovering their\nhearts to the dead. Then Quaan cried, &quot;Hail!&quot; and led his warriors\nback to the work of piling Cavewights and burying Woodhelvennin.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>After the Eoman had left, High\nLord Prothall said to Mhoram, &quot;Lord Variol's staff. From father to son.\nTake it. If we survive this Quest to reach a time of peace, master it. It has\nbeen the staff of a High Lord.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Mhoram accepted it with a bow.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Prothall paused for a moment,\nirresolute, then turned to Covenant. &quot;You have used Lord Tamarantha's\nstaff. Take it for use again. You will find it readier to aid your ring than\nyour Hirebrand's staff. The lillianrill work in other ways than the Lords, and\nyou are ur-Lord, Thomas Covenant.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Remembering the red blaze which\nhad raged out of that wood to kill and kill, Covenant said, &quot;Burn\nit.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>A touch of danger tightened\nMhoram's glance. But Prothall shrugged gently, took Lord Tamarantha's staff to\nthe fire, and placed it into the cleft of the tree.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>For an instant, the metal ends of\nthe staff shone as if they were made of verdigris. Then Mhoram cried,\n&quot;Ware the tree!&quot; Quickly, the company moved away from the fiery\nspars.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The staff gave a sharp report like\nthe bursting of bonds. Blue flame detonated in the cleft, and the riven tree\ndropped straight to the ground in fragments, collapsing as if its core had been\nfinally killed. The heap of wood burned furiously.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>From a distance, Covenant heard\nBirinair snort, &quot;The Unbeliever's doing,&quot; as if that were a calumny.\nDon't touch me, he muttered to himself.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>He was afraid to think. Around\nhim, darkness lurked like vulture wings made of midnight. Horrors threatened;\nhe felt ghoul-begotten. He could not bear the bloodiness of his ring, could not\nbear what he had become. He searched about him as if he were looking for a\nfight.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Unexpectedly, Saltheart\nFoamfollower returned.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>He shambled out of the night like\na massacre metaphored in flesh-an icon of slaughter. He was everywhere smeared\nin blood, and much of it was his own. The wound on his forehead covered his\nface with a dark, wet sheen, and through the stain his deep eyes looked sated\nand miserable. Shreds of Cavewight flesh still clung to his fingers.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Pietten pointed at the Giant, and\ntwisted his lips in a grin that showed his teeth. At once, Llaura grabbed his\nhand, pulled him away to a bed which the warriors had made for them.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Prothall and Mhoram moved\nsolicitously toward the Giant, but he pushed past them to the fire. He knelt near\nthe blaze as if his soul needed warming, and his groan as he sank to his knees\nsounded like a rock cracking.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant saw his chance,\napproached the Giant. Foamfollower's manifest pain brought his confused,</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>angry grief to a pitch that\ndemanded utterance. He himself had killed five Cavewights, five-! His ring was\nfull of blood. &quot;Well,&quot; he snarled, &quot;that must've been fun. I\nhope you enjoyed it.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>From the other side of the camp,\nQuaan hissed threateningly. Prothall moved to Covenant's side, said softly,\n&quot;Do not torment him. Please. He is a Giant. This is the caamora, the fire\nof grief. Has there not been enough pain this night?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>I killed five Cavewights! Covenant\ncried in bereft fury.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>But Foamfollower was speaking as\nif entranced by the fire and unable to hear them. His voice had a keening\nsound; he knelt before the fire in an attitude of lament.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Ah, brothers and sisters,\ndid you behold me? Did you see, my people? We have come to this. Giants, I am\nnot alone. I feel you in me, your will in mine. You would not have done\ndifferently-not felt other than I felt, not grieved apart from my grief. This\nis the result. Stone and Sea! We are diminished. Lost Home</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>and weak seed have made us less\nthan we were. Do we remain faithful, even now? Ah, faithful? My people, my\npeople, if steadfastness leads to this? Look upon me! Do you find me admirable?\nI stink of hate and unnecessary death.&quot; A chill blew through his words.\nTilting back his head, he began a low chant.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>His threnody went on until\nCovenant felt driven to the brink of screaming. He wanted to hug or kick the\nGiant to make him cease. His fingers itched with mounting frenzy. Stop! he\nmoaned. I can't stand it!</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>A moment later, Foamfollower bowed\nhis head and fell silent. He remained still for a long time as if he were\npreparing himself. Then he asked flatly, &quot;Who has been lost?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Very few,&quot; Prothall\nanswered. &quot;We were fortunate. Your valor served us well.&quot;\n&quot;Who?&quot; Foamfollower ached.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>With a sigh, Prothall named the\nfive warriors, the Bloodguard, Variol and Tamarantha.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Stone and Sea!&quot; the\nGiant cried. With a convulsion of his shoulders, he thrust his hands into the\nfire. The warriors gasped; Prothall stiffened at Covenant's side. But this was\nthe Giantish caamora, and no one dared interfere.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Foamfollower's face stretched in\nagony, but he held himself still. His eyes seemed to bulge in their sockets;\nyet he kept his hands in the fire as if the blaze could heal, or at least sear,\nthe blood on them, cauterize if it could not assuage the stain of shed life.\nBut his pain showed in his forehead. The hard heart-pulse of hurt broke the\ncrust on his wound; new blood dripped around his eyes and down his cheeks into\nhis beard.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Panting, Hellfire hellfire!\nCovenant pushed away from Prothall. Stiffly, he went close to the kneeling\nGiant. With a fierce effort that made him sound caustic in spite of his intent,\nhe said, &quot;Now somebody really ought to laugh at you.&quot; His jutting\nhead was barely as high as the Giant's shoulder.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>For a moment, Foamfollower gave no\nsign of having heard. But then his shoulders slumped. With a slow exertion\nalmost as though he were reluctant to stop torturing himself, he withdrew his\nhands. They were unharmed-for some reason, his flesh was impervious to\nflame-but the blood was gone from them; they looked as clean as if they had\nbeen scrubbed by exoneration.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>His fingers were still stiff with\nhurt, and he flexed them painfully before he turned his bloody face toward\nCovenant. As if he were appealing a condemnation, he met the Unbeliever's\nimpacted gaze and asked, &quot;Do you feel nothing?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Feel?&quot; Covenant\ngroaned. &quot;I'm a leper.&quot; &quot;Not even for tiny Pietten? A\nchild?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>His appeal made Covenant want to\nthrow his arms around the Giant, accept this terrible sympathy as some kind of\nanswer to his dilemma. But he knew it was not enough, knew in the deepest\nmarrow of his leprosy that it did not suffice. &quot;We killed them too,&quot;\nhe croaked. &quot;I killed- I'm no different than they are.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Abruptly he turned, walked away\ninto the darkness to hide his shame. The battleground was a fit and</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>proper place for him; his nostrils\nwere numb to the stink of death. After a time, he stumbled, then. lay down\namong the dead, on blood surrounded by graves and pyres.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Children! He was the cause of\ntheir screams and their agony. Foul had attacked the Woodhelven because of his\nwhite gold ring. Not again- I won't. His voice was empty of weeping.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>I will not do any more killing.<br\nclear=all style='page-break-before:always'>\n</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><a name=\"_Toc370739023\"><span class=Heading1Char><span\nstyle='font-size:16.0pt;line-height:105%'>EIGHTEEN: The Plains of Ra</span></span></a></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Despite the battleground-despite\nthe acrid smoke of flame and flesh and power-despite the nearby trenches, where\nthe dead were graved like lumps of charred agony, piled wearily into the earth\nlike accumulated pain for which only the ground could now find use or\nsurcease-despite his own inner torn and trampled ground-Covenant slept. For\nwhat was left of the night, the other survivors of the battle labored to bury\nor burn the various dead, but Covenant slept. Restless unconsciousness arose\nfrom within him like a perpetually enumerated VSE, and he spent his repose\ntelling in dreams that rigid round:</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>left arm shoulder to wrist, left\nhand palm and back, each finger, right arm, shirt, chest, left leg.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>He awoke to meet a dawn which wore\nthe aspect of an uncomfortable tomb. Shuddering himself to his feet, he found\nthat all the work of burying was done; each of the trenches was filled, covered\nwith dirt, and planted with a sapling which Birinair had found somewhere. Now\nmost of the warriors lay awkwardly on the ground, in fatigue searching\nthemselves for some kind of strength. But Prothall and Mhoram were busy cooking\na meal, and the Bloodguard were examining and readying the horses.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>A spate of disgust crossed\nCovenant's face-disgust that he had not done his share of the work. He looked\nat his robe; the samite was stiff and black with encrusted blood. Fit apparel\nfor a leper, he thought, an outcast.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>He knew that it was past time for\nhim to make a decision. He had to determine where he stood in his impossible\ndilemma. Propped on his staff in the sepulchral dawn, he felt that he had\nreached the end of his evasions. He had lost track of his self-protective\nhabits, lost the choice of hiding his ring, lost even his tough boots-and he\nhad shed blood. He had brought down doom on Soaring Woodhelven. He had been so\npreoccupied with his flight from madness that he had not faced the madness\ntoward which his fleeing took him.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>He had to keep moving; he had\nlearned that. But going on posed the same impenetrable problem. Participate,\nand go mad. Or refuse to participate, and go mad. He had to make a decision,\n-find bedrock somewhere and cling to it. He could not accept the Land- and\ncould not deny it. He needed an answer. Without it, he would be trapped like\nLlaura-forced to the tune of Foul's glee to lose himself in order to avoid\nlosing himself.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Then Mhoram looked up from his\nstirring and saw the disgust and dismay on Covenant's face. Gently, the Lord\nsaid, &quot;What troubles you, my friend?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>For a moment, Covenant stared at\nMhoram. The Lord looked as if he had become old overnight. The</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>smoke and dirt of battle marked\nhis face, accentuating the lines on his forehead and around his eyes like a\nsudden aggravation of wear and decay. His eyes seemed dulled by fatigue. But\nhis lips retained their kindness, and his movements, though draped in such a\nrent and bloodied robe, were steady.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant flinched instinctively\naway from the tone in which Mhoram said, my friend. He could not afford to be\nanyone's friend. And he flinched away, too, from his impulse to ask what had\ncaused Tamarantha's staff to become so violent in his hands. He feared the\nanswer to that question. To cover his wincing, he turned roughly away, and went\nin search of Foamfollower.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The Giant was sitting with his\nback to the last standing, extinguished fragment of Soaring Woodhelven. Grime\nand blood darkened his face; his skin had the color of a flaw in the heart of a\ntree. But the wound on his forehead dominated his appearance. Ripped flesh hung\nover his brows like a foliage of pain, and through the wound; drops of new\nblood seeped as if red thoughts were making their way from a crack in his skull.\nHe had his right arm wrapped around his great jug of diamondraught, and his\neyes followed Llaura as she tended little Pietten.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant approached the Giant; but\nbefore he could speak, Foamfollower said, &quot;Have you considered them? Do\nyou know what has been done to them?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The question raised black echoes\nin Covenant's mind. &quot;I know about her.&quot; &quot;And Pietten? Tiny\nPietten? A child?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant shrugged awkwardly.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Think, Unbeliever!&quot; His\nvoice was full, of swirling mists. &quot;I am lost. You can understand.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>With an effort, Covenant replied,\n&quot;The same thing. Just exactly what's been done to us. And to Llaura.&quot;\nA moment later he added mordantly, &quot;And to the Cavewights.&quot;\nFoamfollower's eyes shied, and Covenant went on, &quot;We're all going to\ndestroy-whatever we want to preserve. The essence of Foul's method. Pietten is\na present to us-an example of what we're going to do to the Land when we try to\nsave it. Foul is that confident. And prophecies like that are self\nfulfilling.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>At this, Foamfollower stared at\nCovenant as if the Unbeliever had just laid a curse on him. Covenant tried to\nhold the Giant's eyes, but an unexpected shame made him drop his head. He\nlooked at the power scorched grass. The burning of the grass was curious. Some\npatches did not look as wrong as others-apparently Lords-fire did less\nessential damage than the might of the ur-viles.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>After a moment, Foamfollower said,\n&quot;You forget that there is a difference between a prophet and a seer.\nSeeing the future is not prophecy.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant did not want to think\nabout it. To get away from the subject, he demanded, &quot;Why didn't you get\nsome of that hurtloam for your forehead?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>This time, Foamfollower's eyes\nturned away. Distantly, he said, &quot;There was none left.&quot; His hands\nopened and closed in a gesture of helplessness. &quot;Others were dying. And\nothers needed the hurtloam to save their arms or legs. And-&quot; His voice\nstumbled momentarily. &quot;And I thought tiny Pietten might be helped. He is\nonly a child,&quot; he insisted, looking up suddenly with an appeal that\nCovenant could not understand. &quot;But one of the Cavewights was dying\nslowly-in such pain.&quot; A new trickle of blood broke open in his forehead\nand began to drip from his brow. &quot;Stone and Sea!&quot; he moaned. &quot;I\ncould not endure it. Hearthrall Birinair kept aside a touch of hurtloam for me,\nfrom all the wounds to be treated. But I gave</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>it to the Cavewight. Not to\nPietten-to the Cavewight. Because of the pain.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Abruptly, he put back his head and\ntook a long pull of diamondraught. With the heel of his palm he wiped roughly\nat the blood on his brows.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant gazed intently at the\nGiant's wracked visage. Because he could find no other words for his sympathy,\nhe asked, &quot;How're your hands?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;My hands?&quot; Foamfollower\nseemed momentarily confused, but then he remembered. &quot;Ah, the caamora. My\nfriend, I am a Giant,&quot; he explained. &quot;No ordinary fire can harm me.\nBut the pain-the pain teaches many things.&quot; A flinch of self disgust\ncrossed his lips. &quot;It is said that the Giants are made of granite,&quot;\nhe mumbled. &quot;Do not be concerned for me.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>On an impulse, Covenant responded,\n&quot;In parts of the world where I come from, there are little old ladies who\nsit by the side of the road pounding away all day on hunks of granite with\nlittle iron hammers. It takes a long time-but eventually they turn big pieces into\nlittle pieces.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Foamfollower considered briefly\nbefore asking, &quot;Is that prophecy, ur-Lord Covenant?&quot; &quot;Don't ask\nme. I wouldn't know a prophecy if it fell on me.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Nor would I,&quot; said\nFoamfollower. A dim smile tinged his mouth.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Shortly, Lord Mhoram called the\ncompany to the meal he and Prothall had prepared. Through a haze of suppressed\ngroans, the warriors pried themselves to their feet and moved toward the fire.\nFoamfollower lurched upright. He and Covenant followed Llaura and Pietten to\nget something to eat.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The sight and smell of food\nsuddenly brought Covenant's need for decision to a head. He was empty, hollow\nwith hunger, but when he reached out to take some bread, he saw how his arm was\nbefouled with blood and ashes. He had killed- The bread dropped from his\nfingers. This is all wrong, he murmured. Eating was a form of acquiescence-a\nsubmission to the physical actuality of the Land. He could not afford it.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>I've got to think.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The emptiness in him ached with\ndemands, but he refused them. He took a drink of springwine to clear his\nthroat, then turned away from the fire with a gesture of rejection. The Lords\nand Foamfollower looked after him inquiringly, but made no comment.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>He needed to put himself to the\ntest, discover an answer that would restore his ability to survive. With a\ngrimace, he resolved to go hungry until he found what he required. Perhaps in\nhunger he would become lucid enough to solve the fundamental contradiction of\nhis dilemma.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>All the abandoned weapons had been\ncleared from the glade, gathered into a pile. He went to it and searched until\nhe found Atiaran's stone knife. Then, on an obscure impulse, he walked over to\nthe horses to see if Dura had been injured. When he learned that she was\nunscathed, he felt a vague relief. He did not want under any circumstances to\nbe forced to ride a Ranyhyn.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>A short time later, the warriors\nfinished their meal. Wearily, they moved to take up the Quest again.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>As Covenant mounted Dura, he heard\nthe Bloodguard whistle sharply for the Ranyhyn. The call seemed</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>to hang in the air for a moment.\nThen, from various directions around the glade, the great horses came\ngalloping-manes and tails flaring as if afire, hooves pounding in long, mighty,\ntrip-rhythmed strides -nine star-browed chargers as swift and elemental as the\nlife-pulse of the Land. Covenant could hear in their bold nickering the\nexcitement of going home, toward the Plains of Ra.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>But the Questers who left dead\nSoaring Woodhelven that morning had little of the bold or home-going in their\nattitudes. Quaan's Eoman was now six warriors short, and the survivors were\ngaunt with weariness and battle. They seemed to carry their shadows in their\nfaces as they rode north toward the Mithil River. The riderless horses they\ntook with them to provide relief for the weaker mounts. Among them, Saltheart\nFoamfollower trudged as if he were carrying the weight of all the dead. In the\ncrook of one arm he cradled Pietten, who had fallen asleep as soon as the sun\ncleared the eastern horizon. Llaura rode behind Lord Mhoram, gripping the sides\nof his robe. She appeared bent and frail behind his grim-set face and erect\nposture; but he shared with her an eroded expression, an air of inarticulate\ngrief. Ahead of them moved Prothall, and his shoulders bespoke the same kind of\ninflexible will which Atiaran had used to make Covenant walk from Mithil\nStonedown to the Soulsease River.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Vaguely, Covenant wondered how\nmuch farther he would have to follow other people's choices. But he let the\nthought go and looked at the Bloodguard. They were the only members of the\ncompany who did not appear damaged by the battle. Their short robes hung in\ntatters; they were as filthy as anyone; one of their number had been killed,\nand several were injured. They had defended the Lords, especially Variol and Tamarantha,\nto the utmost; but the Bloodguard were unworn and undaunted, free of rue.\nBannor rode his prancing, reinless Ranyhyn beside Covenant, and gazed about him\nwith an impervious eye.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The horses of the company could\nmanage only a slow, stumbling walk, but even that frail pace brought the riders\nto the ford of the Mithil before noon. Leaving their mounts to drink or graze,\nall of them except the Bloodguard plunged into the stream. Scrubbing at\nthemselves with fine sand from the river bottom,</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>they washed the blood and grit and\npain of death and long night into the wide current of the Mithil. Clear skin\nand eyes reappeared from under the smears of battle; minor un-hurtloamed wounds\nopened and bled clean; scraps of shredded clothing floated out of reach. Among\nthem, Covenant beat his robe clean, rubbed and scratched stains from his flesh\nas if he were trying to rid himself of the effects of killing. And he drank\nquantities of water in an effort to appease the aching hollowness of his\nhunger.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Then, when the warriors were done,\nthey went to their horses to get new clothing from their saddlebags. After they\nhad dressed and regained command of their weapons, they posted themselves as\nsentries while First Mark Tuvor and the Bloodguard bathed.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The Bloodguard managed to enter\nand leave the river without splashing, and they washed noiselessly. In a few\nmoments, they were dressed in new robes and mounted on the Ranyhyn. The Ranyhyn\nhad refreshed themselves by crossing into Andelain and rolling on the grass\nwhile their riders bathed. Now the company was ready to travel. High Lord\nProthall gave the signal, and - the company rode away eastward along the south\nbank of the river.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The rest of the day was easy for\nthe riders and their mounts. There was soft grass underhoof, clean water at one\nside, a tang of vitality in the air, and a nearby view of Andelain itself,\nwhich seemed to pulse with robust sap. The people of the Land drew healing from\nthe ambience of the Hills. But the day was hard for Covenant. He was hungry,\nand the vital presence of Andelain only made him hungrier.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>He kept his gaze away from it as\nbest he could, refusing the sight as he had refused food. His gaunt face was\nset in stern lines, and his eyes were hollow with determination. He followed a\ndouble path: his flesh rode Dura doggedly, keeping his position in the company;\nbut in his mind, he wandered in chasms, and their dark, empty inanition hurt\nhim.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>I will not.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>He wanted to survive. I am not.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>From time to time, aliantha lay\ndirectly in his path like a personal appeal from the Land, but he did not\nsuccumb.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant, he thought. Thomas\nCovenant. Unbeliever. Leper outcast unclean. When a pang from his hunger made\nhim waver, he remembered Drool's bloody grip on his ring, and his resolve\nsteadied.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>From time to time, Llaura looked\nat him with the death of Soaring Woodhelven in her eyes, but he only clenched\nhimself harder and rode on.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>I won't do any more killing.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>He had to have some other answer.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>That night, he found that a change\nhad come over his ring. Now all evidence that it resisted red encroachments was\ngone. His wedding band burned completely crimson under the dominion of the\nmoon, flaming coldly on his hand as if in greedy response to Drool's power. The\nnext morning, he began the day's riding like a man torn between opposing poles\nof insanity.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>But there was a foretaste of\nsummer in the noon breeze. The air turned warm and redolent with the ripeness\nof the earth. The flowers had a confident bloom, and the birds sang languidly.\nGradually,</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant grew full of lassitude.\nLanguor loosened the strings of his will. Only the habit of riding kept him on\nDura's back; he became numb to such superficial considerations. He hardly\nnoticed when the river began to curve northward away from the company, or when\nthe hills began to climb higher. He moved blankly on the warm currents of the\nday. That night he slept deeply, dreamlessly, and the next day he rode on in\nnumbness and unconcern.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Waking slumber held him. It was a\nwilderland that he wandered unaware; he was in danger without knowing it.\nLassitude was the first step in an inexorable. logic, the law of leprosy. The\nnext was gangrene, a stink of rotting live flesh so terrible that even some\nphysicians could not bear it-a stench which ratified the outcasting of lepers\nin a way no mere compassion or unprejudice could oppose. But Covenant traveled\nhis dream with his mind full of sleep.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>When he began to recover-early in\nthe afternoon of the third day from Soaring Woodhelven, the eighteenth since\nthe company had left Revelstone-he found himself looking over Morinmoss Forest.\nThe company stood on the last hilltop before the land fell under the dark aegis\nof the trees.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Morinmoss lay at the foot of the\nhill like a lapping sea; its edges gripped the hillsides as if the trees had\nclenched their roots in the slopes and refused to be driven back. The dark,\nvarious green of the Forest spread to the horizon north and east and south. It\nhad a forbidding look; it seemed to defy the Quest to pass through it. High\nLord Prothall stopped on the crest of the hill, and gazed for a long time over\nthe Forest, weighing the time needed to ride around Morinmoss against the\nobscure dangers of the trees.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Finally, he dismounted. He looked\nover the riders, and his eyes were full of potential anger as he spoke.\n&quot;We will rest now. Then we will ride into Morinmoss, and will not stop\nuntil we have reached the far side</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>-a journey of nearly a day and a\nnight. During that ride, we must show neither blade nor spark. Hear you? All\nswords sheathed, all arrows quivered, all knives cloaked, all spear tips bound.\nAnd every spark or gleam of fire quenched. I will have no mistake. Morinmoss is\nwilder than Grimmerdhore-and none go unanxious into that wood. The trees have\nsuffered for ages, and they do not forget their kinship with Garroting Deep.\nPray that they do not - crush us all, regardless.&quot; He paused, scanning the\ncompany until he was sure that all understood him. Then he added more gently,\n&quot;It is possible that there is still a Forestal in Morinmoss-though that\nknowledge has been lost since the Desecration.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Several of the warriors tensed at\nthe word Forestal. But Covenant, coming slowly out of his languor, felt none of\nthe awe which seemed to be expected of him. He asked as he had once before,\n&quot;Do you worship trees?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Worship?&quot; Prothall\nseemed puzzled. &quot;The word is obscure to me.&quot; Covenant stared.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>A moment later, the High Lord went\non, &quot;Do you ask if we reverence the forests? Of course. They are alive,\nand there is Earthpower in all living things, all stone and earth and water and\nwood. Surely you understand that we are the servants of that Power. We care for\nthe life of the Land.&quot; He glanced back at the Forest, then continued,\n&quot;The Earthpower takes many forms between wood and stone. Stone bedrocks\nthe world, and to the best of our comprehension weak as it is-that form of\npower does not know itself. But wood is otherwise.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;At one time, in the dimmest,\nlost distance of the past, nearly all the Land was One Forest-one mighty wood\nfrom Trothgard and Melenkurion Skyweir to Sarangrave Flat and Seareach. And the\nForest was awake. It knew and welcomed the new life which people brought to the\nLand. It felt the pain when mere men-blind, foolish moments in the ancientness\nof the Land--cut down and burned out the trees to make space in which to breed\ntheir folly. Ah, it is hard to take pride in human history. Before the slow\nknowledge spread throughout the Forest, so that each tree knew its peril,\nhundreds of leagues of life had been decimated. By our reckoning, the deed took\ntime -more than a thousand years. But it must have seemed a rapid murder to the\ntrees. At the end of that time, there were only four places left in the Land\nwhere the soul of the Forest lingered-survived, and shuddered in its awesome\npain-and took resolve to defend itself. Then for many ages Giant Woods and\nGrimmerdhore and Morinmoss and Garroting Deep lived, and their awareness\nendured in the care of the Forestals. They remembered, and no human or Vile or\nCavewight who dared enter them survived.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Now even those ages are\npast. We know not if the Forestall yet live-though only a fool would deny that\nCaerroil Wildwood still walks in Garroting Deep. But the awareness which\nenabled the trees to strike back is fading. The Lords have defended the Forests\nsince Berek Halfhand first took up the Staff of Law-we have not let the trees\ndiminish. Yet their spirit fails. Cut off from each other, the collective\nknowledge of the Forests dies. And the glory of the world becomes less than it\nwas.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Prothall paused sadly for a moment\nbefore concluding, &quot;It is in deference to the remaining spirit, and in\nreverence for the Earthpower, that we ask permission for so many to enter the\nForest at one time. And it is in simple caution that we offer no offense. The\nspirit is not dead. And the power of Morinmoss could crush a thousand thousand\nmen if the trees were pained into wakefulness &quot;Are there other\ndangers?&quot; Quaan asked. &quot;Will we need our weapons?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;No. Lord Foul's servants\nhave done great harm to the Forests in ages past. Perhaps Grimmerdhore has lost\nits power, but Morinmoss remembers. And tonight is the dark of the moon. Even\nDrool</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Rockworm is not mad enough to\norder his forces into Morinmoss at such a time. And the Despiser has never been\nsuch a fool.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Quietly, the riders dismounted.\nSome of the Eoman fed the horses, while others prepared a quick meal. Soon all\nthe company except Covenant had eaten. And after the meal, while the Bloodguard\nwatched,</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>the Questers laid themselves down\nto rest before the long passage of the Forest.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>When they were roused again and\nready to travel, Prothall strode up to the edge of the hillcrest. The breeze\nwas stronger there; it guttered his blacksashed blue robe as he raised his\nstaff and cried loudly, &quot;Hail, Morinmoss! Forest of the One Forest! Enemy\nof our enemies! Morinmoss, hail!&quot; His voice fell into the expanse of the\nwoods forlornly, without echo. &quot;We are the Lords-foes to your enemies, and\nlearners of the lillianrill lore! We must pass through!</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Harken, Morinmoss! We hate\nthe ax and game which hurt you! Your enemies are our enemies. Never have we\nbrought edge of ax or flame of fire to touch you-nor ever shall. Morinmoss,\nharken! Let us pass!&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>His call disappeared into the\ndepths of the Forest. At last, he lowered his arms, then turned and came back\nto the company. He mounted his horse, looked once more sternly over the riders.\nAt his signal, they rode down toward the knuckled edges of Morinmoss.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>They seemed to fall like a stone\ninto the Forest. One moment, they were still winding down the hillside above\nthe trees; the next, they had penetrated the gloomy deep, and the sunlight\nclosed behind them like an unregainable door. Birinair went at the head of the\ncompany, with his Hirebrand's staff held across his mount's neck; and behind\nhim rode First Mark Tuvor on the Ranyhyn stallion Marny-for the Ranyhyn had\nnothing to fear from the old anger of Morinmoss, and Marny could guide Birinair\nif the aged Hearthrall went astray. Behind Tuvor came Prothall and Mhoram, with\nLlaura at Mhoram's back; and behind them came Covenant and Foamfollower. The\nGiant still carried the sleeping child. Then followed Quaan and his Eoman,\nbunched together among the Bloodguard.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>There was room for them to pass.\nThe trees with their dark-mingled ebony and russet trunks were widely placed,\nleaving space between them for undergrowth and animals; and the riders found\ntheir way without difficulty. But the trees were not tall. They rose for\nfifteen or twenty feet on squat trunks, then spread outward in gnarled,\ndrooping branches heavy with foliage, so that the company was completely\nenshrouded in the gloom of Morinmoss. The branches interwove until each tree\nseemed to be standing with its arms braced heavily on the shoulders of its\nkindred. And from the limbs hung great curtains and strands of moss-dark,\nthick, damp moss falling from the branches like slow blood caught and frozen as\nit bled. The moss dangled before the riders as if it were trying to turn them\naside, deflect them from their path. And on the deep, mossy ground the hooves\nof the horses made no sound. The riders went their way as silently as if they\nhad been translated into an illusion.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Instinctively dodging away from\nthe dark touch of the moss, Covenant peered into the Forest's perpetual\ngloaming. As far as he could see in all directions, he was surrounded by the\ngrotesque ire of moss and branch and trunk. But beyond the limit of his\nexplicit senses he could see more-see, and smell, and in the silence of the\nForest hear, the brooding heart of the woods. There the trees contemplated their\ngrim memories-the broad, budding burst of self awareness, when the spirit of\nthe wood lay grandly over hundreds of leagues of rich earth; and the raw\nplummet of pain and horror and disbelief, spreading like ripples on an ocean\nuntil the farthest leaves in the Land shivered, when the slaughter of the trees\nbegan, root and branch and all cut and consumed by ax and flame, and stumps\ndragged away; and the scurry</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>and anguish of the animals,\nslaughtered too or bereft of home and health and hope; and the clear song of\nthe Forestal, whose tune taught the secret, angry pleasure of crushing, of\nstriking hack at tiny men and tasting their blood at the roots; and the slow\nweakness which ended even that last fierce joy, and left the trees with nothing\nbut their stiff memories and their despair as they watched their rage fall into\nslumber.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant sensed that the trees\nknew nothing of Lords or friendship; the Lords were too recent in the Land to\nbe remembered No, it was weakness, the failure of spirit, that let the riders\npass-weakness, sorrow, helpless sleep. Here and there, he could hear trees that\nwere still awake and aching for blood. But they were too few, too few.\nMorinmoss could only brood, bereft of force by its own ancient mortality.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>A hand of moss struck him, and\nleft moisture on his face. He wiped the wet away as if it were acid. Then the\nsun set beyond Morinmoss, and even that low light was gone. Covenant leaned\nforward in his saddle, alert now, and afraid that Birinair would lose his way,\nor stumble into a curtain of moss and be smothered. But as darkness seeped into\nthe sir as if it were dripping from the enshrouding branches, a change came\nover the wood. Gradually, a silver glow grew on the trunks-grew and\nstrengthened as night filled the Forest, until each tree stood shimmering like\na lost soul in the gloom. The silver light was bright enough to show the riders\ntheir way. Across the shifting patterns of the glow, the moss sheets hung like\nshadows of an abyss-black holes into emptiness-giving the wood a blotched,\nleprous look. But the company huddled together, and rode on through a night\nillumined only by the gleam of the trees, and by the red burn of Covenant's\nring.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>He felt that he could hear the\ntrees muttering in horror at the offense of his wedding band. And its pulsing\nred glow appalled him. Moss fingers flicked his face with a wet, probing touch.\nHe clenched his hands over his heart, trying to pull himself inward, reduce\nhimself and pass unnoticed-rode as if he carried an ax under his robe, and was\nterrified lest the trees discover it.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>That long ride passed like the\nhurt of a wound. Acute throbs finally blurred together, and at last the company\nwas again riding through the dimness of day. Covenant shivered, looked about\nwithin himself. What he saw left him mute. He felt that the cistern of his rage\nwas full of darkness.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>But he was caught in toils of\ninsoluble circumstance. The darkness was a cup which he could neither drink nor\ndash aside.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>And he was trembling with hunger.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>He could hardly restrain himself from\nstriking back at the damp clutch of the moss.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Still the company traveled the\nperpetual twilight of Morinmoss. They were silent, stifled by the enshrouding\nbranches; and in the cloying quiet, Covenant felt as lost as if he had missed\nhis way in the old Forest which had covered all the Land. With vague fury, he\nducked and dodged the grasping of the moss. Time passed, and he had a mounting\ndesire to scream.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Then, finally, Birinair waved his\nstaff over his head and gave a weak shout. The horses understood; they stumbled\ninto a tired run beside the strong step of the Ranyhyn. For a moment, the trees\nseemed to stand back, as if drawing away from the company's madness. Then the\nriders broke out into sunshine. They found themselves under a noon sky on a\nslope which bent gradually down to a river lying squarely across their way.\nBirinair and Marry had brought them unerringly to Roamsedge Ford.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Hoarsely shouting their relief,\nthe warriors set heels to their mounts, and the company swept down the slope at\na brave gallop. Shortly, the horses splashed into the stream, showering\nthemselves and their glad riders with the cool spray of the Roamsedge. On the\nsouthern bank, Prothall called a halt. The passage of Morinmoss was over.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Once halted, the company tasted\nthe toll of the passage. Their foodless vigil had weakened the riders. But the\nhorses were in worse condition. They quivered with exhaustion. Once their last\nrun was over, their necks and backs sagged; they scarcely had the strength to\neat or drink. Despite the nickering encouragement of the Ranyhyn, two of the\nEoman mustangs collapsed on their sides on the grass, and the others stood\naround with unsteady knees like foals. &quot;Rest-rest,&quot; Prothall said in\nrheumy anxiety. &quot;We go no farther this day.&quot; He walked among the horses,\ntouching them with his old hands and humming a strengthening song.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Only the Ranyhyn and the\nBloodguard were unmarred by fatigue. Foamfollower lowered the child Pietten\ninto Llaura's arms, then dropped himself wearily on his back on the stiff\ngrass. Since the company had left Soaring Woodhelven, he had been unnaturally\nsilent; he had avoided speaking as if he feared his voice would betray him. Now\nhe appeared to feel the strain of traveling without the support of stories and\nlaughter.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant wondered if he would ever\nhear the Giant laugh again.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Sourly, he reached a hand up to\nget his staff from Dura's saddle, and noticed for the first time what Morinmoss\nhad done to his white robe. It was spattered and latticed with dark green\nstains-the markings of the moss.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The stains offended him. With a\nscowl, he looked around the company. The other riders must have been more adept\nat dodging; they showed none of the green signature of the moss. Lord Mhoram\nwas the only exception; each shoulder of his robe bore a dark stripe like an\ninsignia.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Roughly, Covenant rubbed at the\ngreen. But it was dry and set. Darkness murmured in his ears like the distant\nrumor of an avalanche. His shoulders hunched like a strangler's. He turned away\nfrom the Questers, stamped back into the river. Knotting his fingers in his\nrobe, he tried to scrub out the stains of the Forest.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>But the marks had become part of\nthe fabric, immitigable; they clung to his robe, signing it like a chart, a map\nto unknown regions. In a fit of frustration, he pounded the river with his\nfists. But its current erased his ripples as if they had never existed.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>He stood erect and dripping in the\nstream. His heart labored in his chest. For a moment, he felt that his rage\nmust either overflow or crack him to the bottom.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>None of this is happening- His jaw\nquivered. I can't stand it.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Then he heard a low cry of\nsurprise from the company. An instant later, Mhoram commanded quietly,\n&quot;Covenant. Come.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Spitting protests against so many\nthings that he could not name them all, he turned around. The Questers were all\nfacing away from him, their attention bent on something which he could not see\nbecause of the water in his eyes.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Mhoram repeated, &quot;Come.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant wiped his eyes, waded to\nthe bank, and climbed out of the river. He made his dripping way through the\nEoman until he reached Mhoram and Prothall.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Before them stood a strange woman.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>She was slim and slight-no taller\nthan Covenant's shoulder-and dressed in a deep brown shift which left her legs\nand arms free. Her skin was sun darkened to the color of earth. Her long black\nhair she wore tied into one strand by a heavy cord. The effect was severe, but\nthis was relieved by a small necklace of yellow flowers. Despite her size, she\nstood proudly, with her arms folded and her legs slightly apart, as if she\ncould deny the company entrance to the Plains of Ra if she chose. She watched\nCovenant's approach as if she had been waiting for him.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>When he stopped, joining Mhoram\nand Prothall, she raised her hand and gave him the salute of welcome awkwardly,\nas if it were not a natural gesture for her. &quot;Hail, Ringthane,&quot; she\nsaid in a clear, nickering voice. &quot;White gold is known. We homage and\nserve. Be welcome.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>He shook the water from his\nforehead and stared at her.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>After greeting him, she turned\nwith a ritual precision toward each of the others. &quot;Hail, High Lord\nProthall. Hail, Lord Mhoram. Hail, Saltheart Foamfollower. Hail, First Mark\nTuvor. Hail, Warhaft Quaan.&quot; In turn, they saluted her gravely, as if they\nrecognized her as a potentate.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Then she said, &quot;I am\nManethrall Lithe. We see you. Speak. The Plains of Ra are not open to\nall.&quot; Prothall stepped forward. Raising his staff, he held it in both\nhands level with his forehead and bowed deeply. At this, the woman smiled\nfaintly. Holding her own palms beside her head, she matched his bow. This time,\nher movement was smooth, natural. &quot;You know us,&quot; she said. &quot;You\ncome from afar, but you ate not unknowing.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Prothall replied, &quot;We know\nthat the Manethralls are the first tenders of the Ranyhyn. Among the Ramen, you\nare most honored. And you know us.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>He stood close to her now, and the\nslight stoop of his agedness inclined him over her. Her brown skin and his blue\nrobe accentuated each other like earth and sky. But still she withheld her\nwelcome. &quot;No,&quot; she returned. &quot;Not know. You come from afar.\nUnknown.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Yet you speak our\nnames.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>She shrugged. &quot;We are\ncautious. We have watched since you left Morinmoss. We heard your talk.&quot;\nWe? Covenant wondered blankly.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Slowly, her eyes moved over the\ncompany. &quot;We know the sleepless ones-the Bloodguard.&quot; She did not\nappear pleased to see them. &quot;They take the Ranyhyn into peril. But we\nserve. They are welcome.&quot; Then her gaze settled on the two collapsed\nhorses, and her nostrils flared. &quot;You have urgency?&quot; she demanded,\nbut her tone said that she would accept few justifications for the condition of\nthe mustangs. At that, Covenant understood why she hesitated to welcome the\nLords, though they must have been known to her, at least by legend or\nreputation; she wanted no one who mistreated horses to enter the Plains of Ra.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The High Lord answered with\nauthority,. &quot;Yes. Fangthane lives.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Lithe faltered momentarily. When\nher eyes returned to Covenant, they swarmed with hints of distant fear.\n&quot;Fangthane,&quot; she breathed. &quot;Enemy of Earth and Ranyhyn. Yes.\nWhite gold knows. The Ringthane is here.&quot; Abruptly, her tone became hard.\n&quot;To save the Ranyhyn from rending.&quot; She looked at Covenant as if\ndemanding promises from him.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>He had none to give her. He stood\nangrily dripping, too soaked with hunger to respond in repudiation or\nacquiescence or shame. Soon she retreated in bafflement. To Prothall, she said,\n&quot;Who is he? What manner of man?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>With an ambivalent smile, Prothall\nsaid, &quot;He is ur-Lord Thomas Covenant, Unbeliever and white gold wielder.\nHe is a stranger to the Land. Do not doubt him. He turned the battle for us\nwhen we were beset by the servants of Fangthane Cavewights and ur-viles, and a\ngriffin spawned in some unknown pit of malice.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Lithe nodded noncommittally, as if\nshe did not understand all his words. But then she said, &quot;There is\nurgency. No action against Fangthane must be hindered or delayed. There have\nbeen other signs.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Rending beasts have sought to\ncross into the Plains. High Lord Prothall, be welcome in the Plains of Ra. Come\nwith all speed to Manhome. We must take counsel.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Your welcome honors\nus,&quot; the High Lord responded. &quot;We return honor in accepting. We will\nreach Manhome the second day from today-if the horses five.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>His cautious speech made Lithe\nlaugh lightly. &quot;You will rest in the hospitality of the Ramen before the\nsun sets a second time from this moment. We have not served the Ranyhyn\nknowledgeless from the beginning. Cords! Up! Here is a test for your\nManeing.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>At once, four figures appeared;\nthey suddenly stood up from the grass in a loose semicircle around the company\nas if they had risen out of the ground. The four, three men and a woman, were\nas slight as Manethrall Lithe, and dressed like her in brown over their tanned\nskin; but they wore no flowers, and had short lengths of rope wrapped around\ntheir waists.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Come, Cords,&quot; said\nLithe. &quot;Stalk these riders no longer. You have heard me welcome them. Now\ntend their horses and their safety. They must reach Manhome before nightfall of\nthe next day.&quot; The four Ramen stepped forward, and Lithe said to Prothall,\n&quot;Here are my Cords-Thew, Hum, Grace, and Rustah. They are hunters. While\nthey learn the ways of the Ranyhyn and the knowing of the Manethralls, they\nprotect the Plains from dangerous beasts. I have spent much time with them-they\ncan care for your mounts.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>With courteous nods to the\ncompany, the Cords went straight to the horses and began examining them.\n&quot;Now,&quot; Lithe continued, &quot;I must depart. The word of your coming\nmust cross the Plains. The Winhomes must prepare for you. Follow Rustah. He is\nnearest to his Maneing. Hail, Lords! We will eat together at nightfall of the\nnew day.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Without waiting for a reply, the\nManethrall turned southward and sprinted away. She ran with surprising speed;\nin a few moments, she had crested a hill and vanished from sight.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Watching her go, Mhoram said to\nCovenant, &quot;It is said that a Manethrall can ran with the Ranyhyn -for a\nshort time.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Behind them, Cord Hum muttered,\n&quot;It is said and it is true.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Mhoram faced the Cord. He stood as\nif waiting to speak. His appearance was much like Lithe's, though his hair had\nnot been permitted to grow as long as hers, and his features had a dour cast.\nWhen he had Mhoram's attention, he said, &quot;There is a grass which will heal\nyour horses. I must leave you to bring it.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Gently, the Lord responded,\n&quot;The knowing is yours. Do what is best.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Hum's eyes widened, as if he had\nnot expected soft words from people who mistreated horses. Then, uncertain of\nhis movements, he saluted Mhoram in Lords' fashion. Mhoram returned a Ramen\nbow. Hum grinned, and was about to gallop away when Covenant abruptly asked,\n&quot;Why don't you ride? You've got all those Ranyhyn.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Mhoram moved swiftly to restrain\nCovenant. But the damage was already done. Hum stared as if he had heard blasphemy,\nand his strong fingers twitched the rope from about his waist, holding it\nbetween his fists like a garrote. &quot;We do not ride.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Have a care, Hurn,&quot;\nsaid Cord Rustah softly. &quot;The Manethrall welcomed him.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Hum glared at his companion, then\nroughly reknotted his rope around his waist. He spun away from the company, and\nsoon vanished as if he had disappeared into the earth.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Gripping Covenant's arm, Mhoram\nsaid sternly, &quot;The Ramen serve the Ranyhyn. That is their reason for life.\nDo not affront them, Unbeliever. They are quick to anger-and the deadliest\nhunters in the Land. There might be a hundred of them within the range of my\nvoice, and you would never know. If they chose to slay you, you would die\nignorant.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant felt the force of the\nwarning. It seemed to invest the surrounding grass with eyes that peered\nbalefully. He felt conspicuous, as if his green-mapped robe were a guide for\ndeadly intentions hidden in the ground. He was trembling again.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>While Hum was away, the rest of\nthe Cords worked on the horses-caressing, cajoling them into taking water and\nfood. Under their hands, most of the mustangs grew steadier. Satisfied that\ntheir mounts were in good hands, the Lords went to talk with Quaan and Tuvor;\nand around them, the warriors began preparing food.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant cursed the aroma. He lay\non the stiff grass and tried to still his gnawing emptiness by staring at the\nsky. Fatigue caught up with him, and he dozed for a while. But soon he was\nroused by a new smell which made his hunger sting in his guts. It came from\nclumps of rich, ferny flowers that the horses were munching-the healing herbs\nwhich Cord Hum had brought for them. All the horses were on their feet now, and\nthey seemed to gain strength visibly as they ate. The piquant odor of the\nflowers gave Covenant a momentary vision of himself on his hands and knees,\nchewing like the horses, and he muttered in suppressed savagery, &quot;Damn\nhorses eat better than we do.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Cord Rustah smiled oddly, and\nsaid, &quot;This grass is poison to humans. It is amanibhavam, the flower of\nhealth and madness. Horses it heals, but men and women-ah, they are not enough\nfor it.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant answered with a glare,\nand tried to stifle the groan of his hunger. He felt a perverse desire to taste\nthe grass; it sang to his senses delectably. Yet the thought that he had been\nbrought so low was bitter to him, and he savored its sourness instead of food.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Certainly, the plants worked\nwonders for the horses. Soon they were feeding and drinking normally-and looked\nsturdy enough to bear riders again. The Questers finished their meal, then\npacked away their supplies. The Cords pronounced the horses ready to travel.\nShortly, the riders were on their way south over the swift hills of Ra, with\nthe Ramen trotting easily beside them.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Under the hooves of the horses,\nthe grasslands rolled and passed like mild billows, giving the company an\nimpression of speed. They rode over the hardy grass up and down short low\nslopes, along shallow valleys between copses and small woods beside thin\nstreams, across broad flats. It was a rough land. Except for the faithful\naliantha, the terrain was unrefined by fruit trees or cultivation or any\nflowers other than amanibhavam. But still the Plains seemed full of elemental\nlife, as if the low, quick hills were formed by the pulse of the soil, and the\nstiff grass were rich enough to feed anything strong enough to bear its\nnourishment. When the sun began to set, the bracken on the hillsides glowed\npurple. Herds of nilgai came out of the woods to drink at the streams, and\nravens flocked clamorously to the broad chintz trees which dotted the flats.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>But the riders gave most of their\nattention to the roaming Ranyhyn. Whether galloping by like triumphal banners\nor capering together in evening play, the great horses wore an aura of majesty,\nas if the very ground they thundered on were proud of their creation. They\ncalled in fierce joy to the bearers of the Bloodguard, and these chargers did\nlittle dances with their hooves, as if they could not restrain the exhilaration\nof their return home. Then the unmounted Ranyhyn dashed away, full of gay blood\nand unfetterable energy, whinnying as they ran. Their calls made the air tingle\nwith vitality.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Soon the sun set in the west,\nbidding farewell to the Plains with a flare of orange. Covenant watched it go\nwith dour satisfaction. He was tired of horses -tired of Ranyhyn and Ramen and\nBloodguard and Lords and quests, tired of the unrest of life. He wanted\ndarkness and sleep, despite the blood burn of his ring, the new-coming crescent\nof the moon, and the vulture wings of horror.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>But when the sun was gone, Rustah\ntold Prothall that the company would have to keep on riding. There was danger,\nhe said. Warnings had been left in the grass by other Ramen. The company would\nhave to ride until they were safe-a few leagues more. So they traveled onward.\nLater, the moon rose, and its defiled sliver turned the night to blood, calling\nup a lurid answer from Covenant's ring and his hungry soul.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Then Rustah slowed the riders,\nwarned them to silence. With as much stealth as they could muster, they angled\nup the south side of a hill, and stopped just below its crest. The company\ndismounted, left a few of the Bloodguard to watch over the horses, and followed\nthe Cords to the hilltop.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Low, flat ground lay to the north.\nThe Cords peered across it for some time, then pointed. Covenant fought the\nfatigue of his eyes and the crimson dimness until he thought he saw a dark\npatch moving southward over the flat.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Kresh,&quot; whispered Hurn.\n&quot;Yellow wolves-Fangthane's brood. They have crossed Roamsedge.&quot;\n&quot;Wait for us,&quot; Rustah breathed. &quot;You will be safe.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>He and the other Cords faded into\nthe night.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Instinctively, the company drew\ncloser together, and stared with throbbing eyes through the thin red light\nwhich seemed to ooze like sweat from the moving darkness on the flat. In\nsuspense, they stood hushed, hardly breathing.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Pietten sat in Llaura's arms, as\nwide awake as a vigil.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>learned later that the pack\nnumbered fifteen of the great yellow wolves. Their fore-shoulders were\nwaist-high on a man; they had massive jaws lined with curved, ripping fangs,\nand yellow omnivorous eyes. They were drooling on the trail of two Ranyhyn\nfoals protected only by a stallion and his mare. The legends of the Ramen said\nthat the breath of such kresh was hot enough to scorch the ground, and they\nleft a weal of pain across the grass wherever their plundering took them. But\nall Covenant saw now was an approaching darkness, growing larger moment by\nmoment.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Then to his uncertain eyes the\nrear of the pack appeared to swirl in confusion briefly; and as the wolves\nmoved on he thought he could see two or three black dots lying motionless on\nthe flat.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The pack swirled again. This time,\nseveral short howls of surprise and fear broke the silence. One harsh snarl was\nsuddenly choked off. The neat instant, the pack started a straight dash toward\nthe company, leaving five more dots behind. But now Covenant was sure that the\ndots were dead wolves.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Three more kresh dropped. Now he\ncould see three figures leap away from the dead and sprint after the survivors.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>They vanished into shadows at the\nfoot of the hill. From the darkness came sounds of fighting-enraged snarls, the\nsnap of jaws that missed their mark, bones cracking.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Then silence flooded back into the\nnight. The apprehension of the company sharpened, for they could see nothing;\nthe shadow reached almost to the crest of the hill where they stood.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Abruptly, they heard the sound of\nfrantic running. It came directly toward them.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Prothall sprang forward. He raised\nhis staff, and blue fire flared from its tip. The sudden light revealed a lone\nkresh with hatred in its eyes pelting at him.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Tuvor reached Prothall's side an\ninstant before Foamfollower. But the Giant went ahead to meet the wolf's\ncharge.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Then, without warning, Cord Grace rose\nout of hiding squarely in front of the wolf. She executed her movement as\nsmoothly as if she were dancing. As she stood, a swift jerk freed her rope.\nWhen the kresh sprang at her, she flipped a loop of the rope around its neck,\nand stepped neatly aside, turning as she did so to brace her feet. The force of\nthe wolf's charge as it hit her noose broke its neck. The yank pulled he from\nher feet, but she rolled lightly to one side, keeping pressure on the rope, and\ncame to her feet in a position to finish the kresh if it were still alive.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The Eoman met her performance with\na low murmur of admiration. She glanced toward them and smiled diffidently in\nthe blue light of Prothall's staff. Then she turned to greet the other Cords as\nthey loped out of the shadow of the hill. They were uninjured. All the wolves\nwere dead.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Lowering his staff, Prothall gave\nthe Cords a Ramen bow. &quot;Well done,&quot; he said. They bowed in\nacknowledgment When he extinguished his staff, red darkness returned to the\nhilltop. In the bloodlight, the riders began moving back to their horses. But\nBannor stepped over to the dead wolf and pulled Grace's rope from around its\nneck. Holding the cord in a fighting grip, he stretched it taut.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;A good weapon,&quot; he said\nwith his awkward inflectionlessness. &quot;The Ramen did mighty work with it in\nthe days when High Lord Kevin fought Corruption openly.&quot; Something in his\ntone reminded Covenant that the Bloodguard were lusty men who had gone unwived\nfor more than two thousand years.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Then, on the spur of an obscure impulse,\nBannor tightened his muscles, and the rope snapped. Shrugging slightly, he\ndropped the pieces on the dead kresh. His movement had the finality of a\nprophecy. Without a glance at Cord Grace, he left the hilltop to mount the\nRanyhyn that had chosen him.<br clear=all style='page-break-before:always'>\n</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><a name=\"_Toc370739024\"><span class=Heading1Char><span\nstyle='font-size:16.0pt;line-height:105%'>NINETEEN: Ringthane's Choice</span></span></a></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Cord Rustah informed Prothall\nthat, according to Ramen custom, dead renders of the Ranyhyn were left for the\nvultures. The Ramen had no desire to honor kresh, or to affront the earth, by\nburying them, and pyres raised the danger of fire on the Plains. So the riders\ncould rest as soon as their horses were away from the smell of death. The Cord\nled the company on southward for nearly a league until he was satisfied that no\nnight breeze would carry unrest to the animals. Then the Quest camped.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant slept fitfully, as if he\nlay with the point of a spike against his stomach; and when the dawn came, he\nfelt as ineffectual as if he had spent the night trying to counterpunch hunger.\nAnd when his nose tasted again the tangy smell of the poison amanibhavam, the\nsensation made his eyes water as if he had been struck.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>He did not believe that he could\nhold himself upright much longer. But he still did not have the answer he\nneeded. He had found no new insight, and the green handiwork of Morinmoss on\nhis robe seemed illegible. A sure instinct told him that he could find what he\nlacked in the extremity of hunger. When his companions had eaten, and were\nready to travel again, he climbed dully onto Dura's back and rode with them.\nHis eyes dripped senselessly from time to time, but he was not weeping. He felt\ncharged with passion, but could not let it out. The grief of his leprosy did\nnot permit any such release.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>In contrast to the cold ash of his\nmood, the day was cheery, full of bright, unclouded sun and a warm northward\nbreeze, of deep sky and swift hills. Soon the rest of the company had\nsurrendered to the spell of the Plains-an incantation woven by the proud\nroaming of the Ranyhyn. Time and again, mighty horses cantered or raced by, glancing\naside at the riders with laughter in their eyes and keen shimmering calls in\ntheir throats. The sight of them added a spring to the strides of the Cords,\nand as the morning passed, Grace and Thew sang together:</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Run, Ranyhyn:</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>gallop, play- feed, and drink, and\ncoat-gloss gleam. You are the marrow of the earth.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>No rein will curb, or bit control\nno claw or fang unpunished rend; no horse-blood drop without the healing grass.\nWe are the Ramen, born to serve:</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Manethrall curry, Cord protect,\nWinhome hearth and bed anneal- our feet do not bear our hearts away.\nGrass-grown hooves, and forehead stars; hocks and withers earth-wood bloom:\nregal Ranyhyn, gallop, run- we serve the Tail of the Sky, Mane of the World.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Hearing the song, Ranyhyn pranced\naround the company and away, running as smoothly as if the ground flowed in\ntheir strides.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>In Foamfollower's arms, Pietten\nstirred and shook off his day sleep for a while to watch the Ranyhyn with\nsomething like longing in his blank eyes. Prothall and Mhoram sat relaxed in\ntheir saddles, as if for the first time since leaving Revelstone they felt that\nthe company was safe. And tears ran down Covenant's face as if it were a wall.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>In his emptiness, the heat of the\nsun confused him. His head seemed to be fulminating, and the sensation made him\nfeel that he was perched on an unsteady height, where great gulfs of\nvertiginous grass snapped like wolves at his heels. But the clingor of his\nsaddle held him on Dura's back. After a time, he dozed into a dream where he\ndanced and wept and made love at the commands of a satirical puppeteer.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>When he awoke, it was mid\nafternoon, and there were mountains across most of the horizon ahead. The\ncompany was making good time. In fact, the horses were cantering now, as if the\nPlains gave them more energy than they could contain. For a moment, he looked\nahead to Manhome, where, he foresaw, a misguided and valueless respect for his\nwedding ring would offer him to the Ranyhyn as a prospective rider. This was\nsurely one of Prothall's reasons for choosing to visit the Plains of Ra before\napproaching Mount Thunder. Honor the ur-Lord, the Ringthane. Ah, hell! He tried\nto envision himself riding a Ranyhyn, but his imagination could not make the\nleap; more than anything else except Andelain, the great, dangerous,\nEarthpowerful horses quintessenced the Land. And Joan had been a breaker of\nhorses. For some reason, the thought made his nose sting, and he tried to hold\nback his tears by gritting his teeth.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The rest of the afternoon he\npassed by watching the mountains. They grew ahead of the company as if the\npeaks were slowly clambering to their feet. Curving away southwest and\nnortheast, the range was not as high as the mountains behind Mithil Stonedown,\nbut it was rugged and raw, as if high pinnacles had been shattered to make\nthose forbidding, impenetrable. Covenant did not know what lay behind the\nmountains, and did not want to know. Their impenetrability gave him an obscure\ncomfort, as if they carne between him and something he could not bear to see.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>They stood up more swiftly now as\nthe company rode at a slow run toward them. The sun was dipping into the\nwestern plains as the riders entered the foothills of a precipitous outcropping\nof the range. And their backs were hued in orange and pink as they crossed a last\nrise, and reached a broad flat glade at the foot of the cliff.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>There, at last, was Manhome.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The bottom of the cliff face for\nthe last two hundred fifty or three hundred feet inclined sharply inward along\na broad, half-oval front, leaving a cave like a deep, vertical bowl in the\nrock. Far back in the cave, where they were protected from the weather, and yet\nstill exposed to the open air, were the hooped tents of the Ramen families. And\nin the front under the shelter of the cliff was the communal area, the open\nspace and fires where the Ramen cooked and talked and danced and sang together\nwhen they were not out on the Plains with the Ranyhyn. The whole place seemed\naustere, as if generations of Ramen had not worn a welcome for themselves in\nthe stone; for Manhome was only a center, a beginning for the Plainsroaming of\na nomadic people.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Perhaps seventy Ramen gathered to\nwatch the company approach. They were nearly all Winhomes, the young and old of\nthe Ramen, and others who needed safety and a secure bed. Unlike the Cords and\nManethralls, they had no fighting ropes.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>But Lithe was there, and she\nwalked lightly out to meet the company with three other Ramen whom Covenant\ntook to be Manethralls also; they wore necklets of yellow flowers like hers,\nand carried their cords in their hair rather than at their waists. The company\nhalted, and Prothall dismounted before the Manethralls. He bowed to them in the\nRamen fashion, and they gestured their welcome in return. &quot;Hail again,\nLords from afar,&quot; said Lithe. &quot;Hail Ringthane and High Lord and Giant\nand Bloodguard. Be welcome to the hearth and bed of Manhome.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>At her salutation, the Winhomes\nsurged forward from under the cliff. As the riders got down from their horses,\neach was greeted by a smiling Winhome bearing a small band of woven flowers.\nWith gestures of ritual stateliness, they fastened the bands to the right\nwrists of their guests.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant climbed off Dura, and\nfound a shy-bold Ramen girl no more than fifteen or sixteen years old standing\nbefore him. She had fine black hair that draped her shoulders, and soft wide\nbrown eyes. She did not smile; she seemed awed to find herself greeting the\nRingthane, the wielder of the white gold. Carefully, she reached out to put her\nflowers around his wrist.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Their smell staggered him, and he\nnearly retched. The band was woven of amanibhavam. Its tang burned his nose\nlike acid, made him so hungry that he felt about to vomit chunks of emptiness.\nHe was helpless to stop the tears that ran from his eyes.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>With a face full of solemnity, the\nWinhome girl raised her hands and touched his tears as if they were precious.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Behind him, the Ranyhyn of the\nBloodguard were galloping off into the freedom of the Plains. The</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Cords were leading the company's\nhorses away to be tended, and more Ramen cantered into the glade in answer to\nthe news of the Quest's arrival. But Covenant kept his eyes on the girl, stared\nat her as if sh were a kind of food. Finally she answered his gaze by saying,\n&quot;I am Winhome Gay. Soon I will share enough knowing to join the\nCords.&quot; After an instant of hesitation, she added, &quot;I am to care for\nyou while you guest here.&quot; When he did not respond, she said hurriedly,\n&quot;Others will gladly serve if my welcome is not accepted.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant remained silent for a\nmoment longer, clenching his useless ferocity. But then he gathered his\nstrength for one final refusal. &quot;I don't need anything. Don't touch\nme.&quot; The words hurt his throat.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>A hand touched his shoulder. He\nglanced around to find Foamfollower beside him. The Giant was looking down at\nCovenant, but he spoke to the pain of rejection in Gay's face. &quot;Do not be\nsad, little Winhome,&quot; he murmured. &quot;Covenant Ringthane tests us. He\ndoes not speak his heart.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Gay smiled gratefully up at\nFoamfollower, then said with sudden sauciness, &quot;Not so little, Giant. Your\nsize deceives you. I have almost reached Cording.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Her gibe appeared to take a moment\nto penetrate Foamfollower. Then his stiff beard twitched.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Abruptly, he began to laugh. His\nglee mounted; it echoed off the cliff above Manhome until the mountain seemed\nto share his elation, and the infectious sound spread until everyone near him\nwas laughing without knowing why. For a long moment, he threw out gales as if\nhe were blowing debris from his soul.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>But Covenant turned away, unable\nto bear the loud weight of the Giant's humor. Hellfire, he growled. Hell and\nblood. What are you doing to me? He had made no decision, and now his capacity\nfor self-denial seemed spent.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>So when Gay offered to guide him\nto his seat for the feast which the Winhomes had prepared, he followed her\nnumbly. She took him under the ponderous overhang of the cliff to a central,\nclear space with a campfire burning in the middle. Most of the company had\nalready entered Manhome. There were two other fires, and the Ramen divided the\ncompany into three groups: the Bloodguard sat around one of the fires; Quaan\nand his fourteen warriors around another; and in the center, the Ramen invited\nProthall, Mhoram, Foamfollower, Llaura, Pietten, and Covenant to join the\nManethralls. Covenant let himself be steered until he was sitting cross-legged\non the smooth stone floor, across the circle from Prothall, Mhoram, and\nFoamfollower. Four Manethralls made places for themselves beside the Lords, and\nLithe seated herself near Covenant. The rest of the circle was filled with\nCords who had come in from the Plains with their Manethrall teachers.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Most of the Winhomes bustled\naround cooking fires farther back in the cave, but one stood behind each guest,\nwaiting to serve. Gay attended Covenant, and she hummed a light melody which\nreminded him of another song he had once heard.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Something there is in beauty which\ngrows in the soul of the beholder like a flower.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Under the wood smoke and the\ncooking odors, he thought that he could smell Gay's clean, grassy fragrance.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>As he sat lumpishly on the stone,\nthe last glow of the sunset waved orange and gold on the roof like an\naffectionate farewell. Then the sun was gone. Night spread over the Plains;\ncampfire flames gave the only light in Manhome. The air was full of bustle and\nlow talk like a hill breeze rich in Ranyhyn scent. But the food Covenant\ndreaded did not come immediately. First, some of the Cords danced</span><b><span\nstyle='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:105%;font-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";\ncolor:black;background:white'>…</span></b></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Three of them performed within the\ncircle where Covenant sat. They danced around the fire with high prancing\nmovements and sang a nickering song to the beat of complex clapping from the\nWinhomes. The smooth flow of their limbs, the sudden eruptions of the dance,\nthe dark tan of their skins, made them look as if they were enacting the pulse\nof the Plains-dancing the pulse by making it fast enough for human eyes to see.\nAnd they repeatedly bent their bodies so that the firelight cast horselike\nshadows on the walls and ceiling.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Occasionally, the dancers leaped\nclose enough to Covenant for him to hear their song:</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Grass-grown hooves, and forehead\nstars; hocks and withers, earth-wood bloom: regal Ranyhyn, gallop, run we serve\nthe Tail of the Sky, Mane of the World.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The words and the dance made him\nfeel that they expressed some secret knowledge, some vision that he needed to\nshare. The feeling repelled him; he tore his eyes away from the dancers to the\nglowing coals of the fire. When the dance was done, he went on staring into the\nfire's heart with a gaze full of vague trepidations.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Then the Winhomes brought food and\ndrink to the circles. Using broad leaves for plates, they piled stew and wild\npotatoes before their guests. The meal was savory with rare herbs which the\nRamen relished in their cooking, and soon the Questers were deep in the feast.\nFor a long time the only sounds in Manhome were those of serving and eating.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>In the midst of the feast,\nCovenant sat like a stunted tree. He did not respond to anything Gay offered\nhim. He stared at the fire; there was one coal in it which burned redly, like\nthe night glow of his ring. He was doing a kind of VSE in his mind, studying\nhis extremities from end to end; and his heart ached in the conviction that he\nwas about to find some utterly unexpected spot of leprosy. He looked as if he\nwere withering.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>After a time, people began to talk\nagain. Prothall and Mhoram handed their leaf plates back to the Winhomes, and\nturned their attention to the Manethralls. Covenant caught glimpses of their\nconversation. They were discussing him the message he had brought to them, the\nrole he played in the fate of the Land. Their physical comfort contrasted\nstrangely with the seriousness of their words.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Near them, Foamfollower described\nthe plight of Llaura and Pietten to one of the Manethralls.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant scowled into the fire. He\ndid not need to look down to see the blood change which came over his ring; he\ncould feel the radiation of wrong from the metal. He concealed the band under\nhis fist and trembled.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The stone ceiling seemed to hover\nover him like a cruel wing of revelation, awaiting the moment of his greatest\nhelplessness to plunge onto his exposed neck. He was abysmally hungry.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>I'm going crazy, he muttered into\nthe flames.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Winhome Gay urged him to eat, but\nhe did not respond.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Across the circle, Prothall was\nexplaining the purpose of his Quest. The Manethralls listened uncertainly, as\nif they had trouble seeing the connection between evils far away and the Plains\nof Ra. So the High Lord told them what had been done to Andelain.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Pietten gazed with blank unfocus\nout into the night, as if he were looking forward to moonrise. Beside him,\nLlaura spoke quietly with the Cords around her, grateful for the Ramen\nhospitality.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>As Foamfollower detailed the\nhorrors which had been practiced on the two survivors of Soaring</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Woodhelven, his forehead knotted\nunder the effort he made to contain his emotion.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The fire shone like a door with an\nintolerable menace waiting behind it. The back of Covenant's neck was stiff\nwith vulnerability, and his eyes stared blindly, like knotholes.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The green stains on his robe\nmarked him like a warning that said, Leper outcast unclean.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>He was nearing the end of his VSE.\nBehind him was the impossibility of believing the Land true. And before him was\nthe impossibility of believing it false.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Abruptly, Gay entered the circle\nand confronted him, with her hands on her hips and her eyes flashing. She stood\nwith her legs slightly apart, so that he saw the bloody coals of the fire\nbetween her thighs.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>He glanced up at her.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;You must take food,&quot;\nshe scolded. &quot;Already you are half dead.&quot; Her shoulders were squared,\ndrawing her shift tight over her breasts. She reminded him of Lena.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Prothall was saying, &quot;He has\nnot told us all that occurred at the Celebration. The ravage of the Wraiths was\nnot prevented-yet we believe he fought the urviles in some way. His companion\nblamed both herself and him for the ill which befell the Dance.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant trembled. Like Lena, he\nthought. Lena? Darkness pounced at him like claws of vertigo. Lena?</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>For an instant, his vision was\nobscured by roaring and black waters. Then he crashed to his feet. He had done\nthat to Lena-done that? He flung the girl aside and jumped toward the fire.\nLena! Swinging his staff like an ax, he chopped at the blaze. But he could not\nfight off the memory, could not throw it back.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The staff twisted with the force\nof the blow, fell from his hands. Sparks and coals shattered, flew in all\ndirections. He had done that to her! Shaking his half-fist at Prothall, he\ncried, &quot;She was wrong! I couldn't help it!&quot;-thinking, Lena! What have\nI done?- &quot;I'm a leper!&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Around him, people sprang to their\nfeet. Mhoram came forward quickly, stretched out a restraining hand.\n&quot;Softly, Covenant,&quot; he said. &quot;What is wrong? We are\nguests.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>But even while he protested,\nCovenant knew that Atiaran had not been wrong. He had seen himself kill at the\nbattle of Soaring Woodhelven, and had thought in his folly that being a killer\nwas something new for him, something unprecedented. But it was not something he\nhad recently become; he had been that way from the beginning of the dream, from\nthe beginning. In an intuitive leap, he saw that there was no difference\nbetween what the ur-viles had done to the Wraiths and what he had done to Lena.\nHe had been serving Lord Foul since his first day in the Land.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;No!&quot; he spat as if he\nwere boiling in acid. &quot;No, I won't do it anymore. I'm not going to be the\nvictim anymore. I will not be waited on by children.&quot; He shook with the\nague of his rage as he cried at himself, You raped her! You stinking bloody\nbastard!</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>He felt as weak as if the\nunderstanding of what he had done corroded his bones. Mhoram said intently,\n&quot;Unbeliever! What is wrong?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;No!&quot; Covenant repeated.\n&quot;No!&quot; He was trying to shout, but his voice sounded distant,\ncrippled. &quot;I will not-tolerate-this. It isn't right. I am going to\nsurvive! Do you hear me?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Who are you?&quot;\nManethrall Lithe hissed through taut lips. With a quick shake of her head, a\nflick of her wrist, she pulled the cord from her hair and held it battle-ready.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Prothall caught her arm. His old\nvoice rattled with authority and supplication. &quot;Forgive, Manethrall. This\nmatter is beyond you. He holds the wild magic that destroys peace. We must\nforgive.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Forgive?&quot; Covenant\ntried to shout. His legs failed under him, but he did not fall. Bannor held him\nerect from behind. &quot;You can't forgive.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Do you ask to be\npunished?&quot; Mhoram said incredulously. &quot;What have you done?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Ask?&quot; Covenant\nstruggled to recollect something. Then he found it. He knew what he had to do.\n&quot;No. Call the Ranyhyn.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;What?&quot; snapped Lithe in\nindignation. And all the Ramen echoed her protest. &quot;The Ranyhyn! Call\nthem.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Are you mad? Have a care,\nRingthane. We are the Ramen. We do not call-we serve. They come as they will.\nThey are not for your calling. And they do not come at night.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Call, I tell you! I! Call\nthem!&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Something in his terrible urgency\nconfounded her. She hesitated, stared at him in confused anger and</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>protest and unexpected compassion,\nthen turned on her heel and strode out of Manhome.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Supported by Bannor, Covenant\ntottered out from under the oppressive weight of the mountain. The company and\nthe Ramen trailed after him like a wake of dumbfounded outrage. Behind them,\nthe red moon had just crested the mountain; and the distant Plains, visible\nbeyond the foothills in front of Manhome, were already awash with crimson. The\nincarnadine flood seemed to untexture the earth, translate rock and soil and\ngrass into decay and bitter blood.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The people spread out on either\nside of the flat so that the open ground was lit by the campfires. Into the\nnight walked Lithe, moving toward the Plains until she stood near the far edge\nof the glade.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant stopped and watched her.\nUnsteadily, but resolutely, he freed himself from Bannor's supportstood on his\nown like a wrecked galleon left by the tide, perched impossibly high on a reef.\nMoving woodenly, he went toward Lithe.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Before him, the bloody vista of\nthe moonlight lay like a dead sea, and it tugged at him as it flowed closer\nwith each degree of the moonrise. His ring smoldered coldly. He felt that he\nwas the lodestone. Sky and earth were alike hued scarlet, and he walked outward\nas if he were the pole on which the red night turnedhe and his ring the force\nwhich compelled that tide of violated night. Soon he stood in the center of the\nopen fiat.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>A winding-sheet of silence\nenwrapped the onlookers.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Ahead of him, Manethrall Lithe\nspread her arms as if she were beckoning the darkness toward her. Abruptly, she\ngave a shrill cry. &quot;Kelenbhrabanal marushyn! Rushyn hynyn kelenkoor\nrillynarunal!</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Ranyhyn Kelenbhrabanal!&quot; Then\nshe whistled once. It echoed off the cliff like a shriek.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>For a long moment, silence choked\nthe flat. Striding defiantly, Lithe moved back toward Manhome. As she passed\nCovenant, she snapped, &quot;I have called.&quot; Then she was behind him, and\nhe faced the siege of the moonlight alone.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>But shortly there came a rumbling\nof hooves. Great horses pounded the distance; the sound swelled as if the hills\nthemselves were rolling Manhome-ward. Scores of Ranyhyn approached. Covenant\nlocked his knees to keep himself upright. His heart felt too weak to go on\nbeating. He was dimly conscious of the hushed suspense of the spectators.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Then the outer edge of the flat\nseemed to rise up redly, and a wave of Ranyhyn broke into the opennearly a\nhundred chargers galloping abreast like a wall at Covenant.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>A cry of amazement and admiration\ncame from the Ramen. Few of the oldest Manethralls had ever seen so many\nRanyhyn at one time.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>And Covenant knew that he was\nlooking at the proudest flesh of the Land. He feared that they were going to\ntrample him.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>But the pounding wall broke away\nto his left, ran around him until he was completely encircled. Manes and tails\ntossing, forehead stars catching the firelight as they flashed past, five score\nRanyhyn thundered on the turf and enclosed him. The sound of their hooves\nroared in his ears.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Their circle drew tighter as they\nran. Their reeling strength snatched at his fear, pulled him around with</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>them as if he were trying to face\nthem all at once. His heart labored painfully. He could not turn fast enough to\nkeep up with them. The effort made him stumble, lose his balance, fall to his\nknees.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>But the next instant, he was erect\nagain, with his legs planted against the vertigo of their circling, and his\nface contorted as if he were screaming-a cry lost in the thunder of Ranyhyn\nhooves. His arms spread as if they were braced against opposing walls of night.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Slowly, tortuously, the circle\ncame stamping and fretting to a halt. The Ranyhyn faced inward toward Covenant.\nTheir eyes rolled, and several of them had froth on their lips. At first, he\nfailed to comprehend their emotion.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>From the onlookers came a sudden\ncry: He recognized Llaura's voice. Turning, he saw Pietten running toward the\nhorses, with Llaura struggling after him, too far behind to catch him. The\nchild had caught everyone by surprise; they had been watching Covenant. Now\nPietten reached the circle and scrambled among the frenzied feet of the\nRanyhyn.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>It seemed impossible that he would\nnot be trampled. His head was no larger than one of their hooves, and the chargers\nwere stamping, skittering. Then Covenant saw his chance. With an instinctive\nleap, he snatched Pietten from under one of the horses.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>His half-unfingered hand could not\nretain its grip; Pietten sprawled away from him. Immediately, the child jumped\nto his feet. He dashed at Covenant and struck as hard as he could.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;They hate you!&quot; he\nraged. &quot;Go away!&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Moonlight fell into the flat as if\nit had sprung from the sides of the mountain. In the crimson glow, Pietten's\nlittle face looked like a wasteland.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The child struggled, but Covenant\nlifted him off the ground, gripped him to his chest with both arms. Restraining\nPietten in his hug, he looked up at the Ranyhyn.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Now he understood. In the past, he\nhad been too busy avoiding them to notice how they reacted to him. They were\nnot threatening him. These great chargers were terrified-terrified of him.\nTheir eyes shied off his face, and they scattered foam flecks about them. The\nmuscles of their legs and chests quivered. Yet they came agonized forward.\nTheir old role was reversed. Instead of choosing their riders, they were\nsubmitting themselves to his choice.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>On an impulse, he unwrapped his\nleft arm from Pietten and flourished his cold red ring at one of the horses. It\nflinched and ducked as if he had thrust a serpent at it, but it held its\nground.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>He gripped Pietten again. The\nchild's struggles were weaker now, as if Covenant's hug slowly smothered him.\nBut the Unbeliever clung. He stared wildly at the Ranyhyn, and wavered as if he\ncould not regain his balance.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>But he had already made his\ndecision. He had seen the Ranyhyn recognize his ring. Clenching Pietten to his\nheart like a helm, he cried, &quot;Listen!&quot; in a voice as hoarse as a sob.\n&quot;Listen. I'll make a bargain with you. Get it right. Hellfire! Get it\nright. A bargain. Listen. I can't stand-I'm falling apart. Apart.&quot; He\nclenched Pietten. &quot;I see-I see what's happening to you. You're afraid.\nYou're afraid of me. You think I'm some kind of- All right. You're free. I\ndon't choose any of you.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The Ranyhyn watched him fearfully.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;But you've got to do things\nfor me. You've got to back off!&quot; That wail almost took the last of his\nstrength. &quot;You-the Land-&quot; he panted, pleaded, Let me be! &quot;Don't\nask so much.&quot; But he knew that he needed something more from them in\nreturn for his forbearance, something more than their willingness to suffer his\nUnbelief.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Listen-listen. If I need\nyou, you had better come. So that I don't have to be a hero. Get it\nright.&quot; His eyes bled tears, but he was not weeping.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;And-and there's one more\nthing. One more. Lena-&quot; Lena! &quot;A girl. She lives in Mithil Stonedown.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Daughter of Trell and Atiaran. I\nwant-I want one of you to go to her. Tonight. And every year. At the las full\nmoon before the middle of spring. Ranyhyn are what she dreams about.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>He shook the tears out of his\neyes, and saw the Ranyhyn regarding him as if they understood everything he had\ntried to say.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Now go,&quot; he gasped.\n&quot;Have mercy on me.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>With a sudden, bursting, united\nneigh, all the Ranyhyn reared around him, pawing the air over his head as if\nthey were delivering promises. Then they wheeled, whinnying with relief, and\ncharged away from Manhome. The moonlight did not appear to touch them. They\ndropped over the edge of the flat and vanished as if they were being welcomed\ninto the arms of the earth.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Almost at once, Llaura reached\nCovenant's side. Slowly, he released Pietten to her. She gave him a long look\nthat he could not read, then turned away. He followed her, trudging as if he\nwere overburdened with the pieces of himself. He could hear the amazement of\nthe Ramen-amazement too strong for them to feel any offense at what he had\ndone. He was beyond them; he could hear it. &quot;They reared to him,&quot; the\nwhispers ran. But he did not care. He was perversely sick with the sense that\nhe had mastered nothing, proved nothing, resolved nothing.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Lord Mhoram came out to join him.\nCovenant did not meet Mhoram's gaze, but he heard complex wonder in the Lord's\nvoice as he said, &quot;Ur-Lord-ah! Such honor has never been done to mortal\nman or woman. Many have come to the Plains, and have been offered to the\nRanyhyn-and refused. And when Lord Tamarantha my mother was offered, five\nRanyhyn came to consider her-five. It was a higher honor than she had dreamed\npossible. We could not hear. Have you refused them? Refused?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Refused,&quot; Covenant\ngroaned. They hate me.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>He pushed past Mhoram and shambled\ninto Manhome. Moving unsteadily, like a ship with a broken keel, he headed\ntoward the nearest cooking fire. The Ramen made way for him, watched him pass\nwith awe in their faces. He did not care. He reached the fire and grabbed the\nfirst food he saw. The meat slipped in his halfhand, so he held it with his\nleft fist and devoured it.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>He ate, blankly, swallowing food\nin chunks and taking more by the fistful. Then he wanted something to drink. He\nlooked around, discovered Foamfollower standing nearby with a flagon of\ndiamondraught dwarfed in his huge hand.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant took the flagon and\ndrained it. Then he stood numbly still, waiting for the diamondraught's effect.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>It came swiftly. Soon mist began\nto fill his head. His hearing seemed hollow, as if he were listening to Manhome\nfrom the bottom of a well. He knew that he was going to pass out-wanted\nhungrily to pass out-but before he lost consciousness, the hurt in his chest\nmade him say, &quot;Giant, I-I need friends.&quot; &quot;Why do you believe\nthat you have none?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant blinked, and saw\neverything that he had done in the Land. &quot;Don't be ridiculous.&quot;\n&quot;Then you do believe that we are real.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;What?&quot; Covenant groped\nfor the Giant's meaning with hands which had no fingers.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;You think us capable of not\nforgiving you,&quot; Foamfollower explained. &quot;Who would forgive you more\nreadily than your dream?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;No,&quot; the Unbeliever\nsaid. &quot;Dreams-never forgive.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Then he lost the firelight and\nFoamfollower's kind face, and stumbled into sleep.<br clear=all\nstyle='page-break-before:always'>\n</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><a name=\"_Toc370739025\"><span class=Heading1Char><span\nstyle='font-size:16.0pt;line-height:105%'>TWENTY: A Question of Hope</span></span></a></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>He wandered wincing in sleep,\nexpecting nightmares. But he had none. Through the vague rise and fall of his\ndrifting as if even asleep his senses were alert to the Land-he felt that he\nwas being distantly watched. The gaze on him was anxious and beneficent; it\nreminded him of the old beggar who had made him read an essay on &quot;the\nfundamental question of ethics.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>When he woke up, he found that\nManhome was bright with sunshine.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The shadowed ceiling of the cave\nwas dim, but light reflecting off the village floor seemed to dispel the\noppressive weight of the stone. And the sun reached far enough into Manhome to\ntell Covenant that he had awakened early in the afternoon of a warm pre-summer\nday. He lay near the back of the cave in an atmosphere of stillness. Beside him\nsat Saltheart Foamfollower.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant closed his eyes\nmomentarily. He felt he had survived a gauntlet. And he had an unfocused sense\nthat his bargain was going to work. When he .' looked up again, he asked,\n&quot;How long have I been asleep?&quot; as if he had just been roused from the\ndead.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Hail and welcome, my\nfriend,&quot; returned the Giant. &quot;You make my diamondraught appear weak.\nYou have slept for only a night and a morning.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Stretching luxuriously, Covenant\nsaid, &quot;Practice. I do so much of it-I'm becoming an expert.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;A rare skill,&quot;\nFoamfollower chuckled.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Not really. There're more of\nus lepers than you might think.&quot; Abruptly he frowned as if he had caught\nhimself in an unwitting violation of his promised forbearance. In order to\navoid being taken seriously, he added in a lugubrious tone, &quot;We're\neverywhere.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>But his attempt at humor only\nappeared to puzzle the Giant. After a moment, Foamfollower said slowly,\n&quot;Are the others- `Leper' is not a good name. It is too short for such as\nyou. I do not know the word, bu my ears hear nothing in it but cruelty.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant sat up and pushed off his\nblankets. &quot;It's s not cruel, exactly.&quot; The subject appeared to shame\nhim. While he spoke, he could not meet Foamfollower's gaze. &quot;It's either a\nmeaningless accidentor a `just desert.' If it were cruel, it would happen more\noften.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;More often?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Sure. If leprosy were an act\nof cruelty-by God or whatever-it wouldn't be so rare. Why be satisfied with a\nfew thousand abject victims when you could have a few million?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Accident,&quot; Foamfollower\nmurmured. &quot;Just. My friend, you bewilder me. You speak with such haste.\nPerhaps the Despiser of your world has only a limited power to oppose its\nCreator.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Maybe. Somehow I don't think\nmy world works that way.&quot; &quot;Yet you said-did you not?-that lepers are\neverywhere.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;That was a joke. Or a\nmetaphor.&quot; Covenant made another effort to turn his sarcasm into humor.\n&quot;I can never tell the difference.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Foamfollower studied him for a\nlong moment, then asked carefully, &quot;My friend, do you jest?&quot; Covenant\nmet the Giant's gaze with a sardonic scowl. &quot;Apparently not.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;I do not understand this\nmood.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Don't worry about it.&quot;\nCovenant caught his chance to escape this conversation. &quot;Let's get some\nfood. I'm hungry.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>To his relief, Foamfollower began\nlaughing gently. &quot;Ah, Thomas Covenant,&quot; he chuckled, &quot;do you\nremember our river journey to Lord's Keep? Apparently there is something in my\nseriousness which makes you hungry.&quot; Reaching down to one side, he brought\nup a tray of bread and cheese and fruit, and a flask of springwine. And he went\non laughing quietly while Covenant pounced on the food.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant ate steadily for some\ntime before he began looking around. Then he was taken aback to find that the\ncave was profuse with flowers. Garlands and bouquets lay everywhere, as if\novernight each Ramen had raised a garden thick with white columbines and\ngreenery. The white and green eased the austerity of Manhome, covered the stone\nlike a fine robe.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Are you surprised?&quot;\nasked Foamfollower. &quot;These flowers honor you. Many of the Ramen roamed all\nnight to gather blooms. You have touched the hearts of the Ranyhyn, and the\nRamen are not unamazed or ungrateful. A wonder has come to pass for them five\nscore Ranyhyn offering to one man. The Ramen</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>would not exchange such a sight\nfor Andelain itself, I think. So they have returned what honor is in their\npower.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Honor? Covenant echoed.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The Giant settled himself more\ncomfortably, and said as if he were beginning a long tale, &quot;It is sad that\nyou did not see the Land before the Desecration. Then the Ramen might have\nshown you honor that would humble all your days. All matters were higher in\nthat age, but even among the Lords there were few beauties to equal the great\ncraft of the Ramen. `Marrowmeld,' they called it-anundivian yajna, in the\ntongue of the Old Lords. Bone-sculpting it was. From vulture and time-cleaned\nskeletons on the Plains of Ra, the Ramen formed figures of rare truth and joy.\nIn their hands-under the power of their songs-the bones bent and flowed like\nclay, and were fashioned curiously, so that from the white core of lost life\nthe Ramen made emblems for the living. I have never beheld these figures, but\nthe tale of them is preserved by the Giants. In the destitution and\ndiminishment, the long generations of hunger and hiding and homelessness, which\ncame to the Ranyhyn and the Ramen with the Desecration, the skill of marrowmeld\nwas lost.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>His voice faded as he finished,\nand after a moment he began to sing softly:</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Stone and Sea are deep in life</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>A silence of respectful attention\nsurrounded .him The Winhomes near him had stopped to listen.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>A short time later, one of them\nwaved out toward the glade, and Covenant, following the gesture, saw Lithe\nstriding briskly across the fiat. She was accompanied by Lord Mhoram astride a\nbeautiful roan Ranyhyn. The sight gladdened Covenant. He finished his\nspringwine in a salute to Mhoram.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Yes,&quot; said\nFoamfollower, noticing Covenant's gaze, &quot;much has occurred this morning.\nHigh Lord Prothall chose not to offer himself. He said that his old bones would\nbetter suit a lesser mount-meaning, I think, that he feared his `old bones'\nwould give affront to the Ranyhyn. But it would be well not to underestimate\nhis strength.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant heard a current of\nintimations running through Foamfollower's words. Distantly, he said,\n&quot;Prothall is going to resign after this Quest-if it succeeds.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The Giant's eyes grinned. &quot;Is\nthat prophecy?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant shrugged. &quot;You know\nas well as I do. He spends too much time thinking about how he hasn't mastered\nKevin's Lore. He thinks he's a failure. And he's going to go on thinking that\neven if he gets the Staff of Law back.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Prophecy, indeed.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Don't laugh.&quot; Covenant\nwondered how he could explain the resonance of the fact that Prothall had refused\na chance at the Ranyhyn. &quot;Anyway, tell me about Mhoram.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Happily, Foamfollower said,\n&quot;Lord Mhoram son of Variol was this day chosen by Hynaril of the Ranyhyn,\nwho also bore Tamarantha Variol-mate. Behold! She is remembered with honor\namong the great horses. The Ramen say that no Ranyhyn has ever before borne two\nriders. Truly, an age of wonders has come to the Plains of Ra.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Wonders,&quot; Covenant\nmuttered. He did not like to remember the fear with which all those Ranyhyn had\nfaced him. He glared into his flask as if it had cheated him by being empty.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>One of the nearest Winhomes\nstarted toward him carrying a jug. He recognized Gay. She approached among the\nflowers, then stopped. When she saw that he was looking at her, she lowered her\neyes. &quot;I would refill your flagon,&quot; she said, &quot;but I fear to\noffend. You will consider me a child.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant scowled at her. She\naffected him like a reproach, and he stiffened where he sat. With an effort\nthat made him sound coldly formal, he said, &quot;Forget last night. It wasn't\nyour fault.&quot; Awkwardly, he extended the flask toward her.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>She came forward, and poured out\nspringwine for him with hands that shook slightly. He said distinctly,\n&quot;Thank you.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>She gazed at him widely for a\nmoment. Then a look of relief filled her face, and she smiled.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Her smile reminded him of Lena.\nDeliberately, as if she were a burden he refused to shirk, he motioned for her\nto sit down. She placed herself cross-legged at the foot of his bed, gleaming\nat the honor the Ringthane did her.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant tried to think of\nsomething to say to her; but before he found what he wanted, he saw Warhaft\nQuaan striding into Manhome. Quaan came toward him squarely, as if he were\nforging against Covenant's gaze, and when he neared the Unbeliever, he waited\nonly an instant before asking his question. &quot;We were concerned. Life needs\nfood. Are you well?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Well?&quot; Covenant felt\nthat he was beginning to glow with his second flask of springwine. &quot;Can't\nyou see? I can see you. You're as sound as an oak.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;You are closed to us,&quot;\nsaid Quaan, stolid with disapproval. &quot;What we see is not what you\nare.&quot; This ambiguous statement seemed to invite a mordant retort, but\nCovenant restrained himself. He shrugged, then said, &quot;I'm eating,&quot; as\nif he did not want to lay claim to too much health.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Quaan seemed to accept this reply\nfor what it was worth. He nodded, bowed slightly, and left. Watching him go,\nWinhome Gay breathed, &quot;He dislikes you.&quot; Her tone expressed awe at\nthe Warhaft's audacity and foolishness. She seemed to ask how he dared to feel\nas he did-as if Covenant's performance the previous night had exalted him in\nher eyes to the rank of a Ranyhyn.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;He has good reason,&quot;\nanswered Covenant flatly.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Gay looked unsure. As if she were\nreaching out for dangerous knowledge, she asked quickly, &quot;Because you\narea-a `leper'?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>He could see her seriousness. But\nhe felt that he had already said too much about lepers. Such talk compromised\nhis bargain. &quot;No,&quot; he said, &quot;he just thinks I'm obnoxious.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>At this, she frowned as if she\ncould hear his complex dishonestly. For a long moment, she studied the floor as\nif she were using the stone to measure his duplicity. Then she got to her feet,\nfilled Covenant's flask to the brim from her jug. As she turned away, she said\nin a low voice, &quot;You do consider me a child.&quot; She walked with a\ndefiant and fearful swing to her hips, as if she believed she was risking her\nlife by treating the Ring. thane so insolently.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>He watched her young back, and\nwondered at the pride of people who served horses-and at the inner conditions\nwhich made telling the truth so difficult.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>From Gay, his gaze shifted to the\nouter edge of Manhome, where Mhoram and Lithe stood together in the sunlight.\nThey were facing each other-she nut brown and he blue-robed-and arguing like\nearth and sky. When he concentrated on them, he could make out what they were\nsaying.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;I will,&quot; she insisted.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;No, hear me,&quot; Mhoram\nreplied. &quot;He does not want it. You will only cause pain for him-and for\nyourself.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant regarded them uneasily\nout of the cool, dim cave. Mhoram's rudder nose gave him the aspect of a man\nwho faced facts squarely; and Covenant felt sure that indeed he did not want\nwhatever Mhoram was arguing against.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The dispute ended shortly.\nManethrall Lithe swung away from Mhoram and strode into the recesses of the\nvillage. She approached Covenant and surprised him entirely by dropping to her\nknees, bowing her forehead to the stone before him. With her palms on the floor\nbeside her head, she said, &quot;I am your servant. You are the Ringthane,\nmaster of the Ranyhyn.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant gaped at the back of her\nhead. For an instant, he did not understand her; in his surprise, he could not\nconceive of any emotion powerful enough to make a Manethrall bow so low. His\nface felt suddenly full of shame. &quot;I don't want a servant,&quot; he grated.\nBut then he saw Mhoram frowning unhappily behind Lithe. He steadied himself,\nwent on more gently, &quot;The honor of your service is beyond me.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;No!&quot; she averred\nwithout raising her head. &quot;I saw. The Ranyhyn reared to you.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>He felt trapped. There seemed to be\nno way to stop her from humiliating herself without making her aware of the\nhumiliation. He had lived without tact or humor for such a long time. But he\nhad promised to be forbearant. And in the distance he had traveled since Mithil\nStonedown, he had tasted the consequences of allowing the people of the Land to\ntreat him as if he were some kind of mythic figure. With an effort, he replied\ngruffly, &quot;Nevertheless. I'm not used to such things. In my own world,\nI'm-just a little man. Your homage makes me uneasy.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Softly, Mhoram sighed his relief,\nand Lithe raised her head to ask in wonder, &quot;Is it possible? Can such\nworlds be, where you are not among the great?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Take my word for it.&quot;\nCovenant drank deeply from his flask.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Cautiously, as if fearful that he\ndid not mean what he had said, she climbed to her feet. She threw back her head\nand shook her knotted hair. &quot;Covenant Ringthane, it shall be as you\nchoose. But we do not</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>forget that the Ranyhyn reared to\nyou. If there is any service we may do, only let it be known. You may command\nus in all things that do not touch the Ranyhyn.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;There is one thing,&quot; he\nsaid, staring at the mountain stone of the ceiling. &quot;Give Llaura and\nPietten a home.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>When he glanced at Lithe, he saw\nthat she was grinning. He snapped fiercely, &quot;She's one of the Heers of\nSoaring Woodhelven. And he's just a kid. They've been through enough to earn a\nlittle kindness.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Gently, Mhoram interposed,\n&quot;Foamfollower has already spoken to the Manethralls. They have agreed to\ncare for Llaura and Pietten.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Lithe nodded. &quot;Such commands\nare easy. If the Ranyhyn did not challenge us more, we would spend most of our\ndays in sleep.&quot; Still smiling, she left Covenant and cantered out into the\nsun.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Mhoram also was smiling. &quot;You\nlook-better, ur-Lord. Are you well?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant returned his attention to\nhis springwine. &quot;Quaan asked me the same thing. How should I know? Half\nthe time these days I can't even remember my name. I'm ready to travel, if\nthat's what you're getting at.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Good. We must depart as soon\nas may be. It is pleasant to rest here in safety. But we must go if we are to\npreserve such safeties. I will tell Quaan and Tuvor to make preparation.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>But before the Lord could leave,\nCovenant said, &quot;Tell me something. Exactly why did we come here? You got\nyourself a Ranyhyn-but we lost four or five days. We could've skipped\nMorinmoss.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Do you wish to discuss\ntactics? We believe we will gain an advantage by going where Drool cannot\nexpect us to go, and by allowing him time to respond to his defeat at Soaring\nWoodhelven. Our hope is that he will send out an army. If we arrive too\nswiftly, the army may still be in Mount Thunder.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant resisted the plausibility\nof this. &quot;You planned to come here long before we were attacked at Soaring\nWoodhelven. You planned it all along. I want to know why.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Mhoram met Covenant's demand\nsquarely, but his face tensed as if he did not expect Covenant to like his\nanswer. &quot;When we made our plans at Revelstone, I saw that good would come\nof this.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;You saw?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;I am an oracle. I\nsee-occasionally.&quot; &quot;And?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;And I saw rightly&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant was not ready to push the\nquestion further. &quot;It must be fun.&quot; But there was little sarcasm in\nhis tone, and Mhoram laughed. His laughter emphasized the kindness of his lips.\nA moment later, he was able to say without bitterness, &quot;I would rather see\nmore such good. There is so little in these times.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>As the Lord walked away to ready\nthe company, Foamfollower said, &quot;My friend, there is hope for you.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Forsooth,&quot; Covenant\nsneered. &quot;Giant, if I were as big and strong as you, there would always be\nhope for me.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Why? Do you believe that\nhope is a child of strength?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Isn't it? Where do you get\nhope if you don't get it from power? If I'm wrong-by hell! There's a lot of\nlepers running around the world confused.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;How is power judged?&quot;\nFoamfollower asked with a seriousness Covenant had not expected.\n&quot;What?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;I do not like the way in\nwhich you speak of lepers. Where is the value of strength if your enemy is\nstronger?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;You assume there is some\nkind of enemy. I think that's a little too easy. I would like nothing better\nthan to blame it on someone else-some enemy who afflicted me. But that's just\nanother kind of suicide.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Abdicate the responsibility to\nkeep myself allve.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Ah, alive,&quot;\nFoamfollower countered. &quot;No, consider further, Covenant. What value has\npower at all if it is not power over death? If you place hope on anything less,\nthen your hope may mislead you.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;SO?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;But the power over death is\na delusion. There cannot be life without death.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant recognized that this was\na fact. But he had not expected such an argument from the Giant. It made him\nwant to get out of the cave into the sunlight. &quot;Foamfollower,&quot; he\nmuttered, climbing out of his bed, &quot;you've been thinking again.&quot; But\nhe felt the intensity of Foamfollower's gaze. &quot;All right. So you're right.\nTell me, just where the hell do you get hope?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Slowly, the Giant rose to his\nfeet. He towered over Covenant until his head nearly touched the ceiling.\n&quot;From faith.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;You've been dealing with\nhumans too long-you're getting hasty. `Faith' is too short a word. What do you\nmean?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Foamfollower began picking his way\namong the flowers. &quot;I mean the Lords. Consider, Covenant. Faith is a way\nof living. They have dedicated themselves wholly to the services of the Land.\nAnd they have sworn the Oath of Peace committed themselves to serve the great\ngoal of their lives in only certain ways, to choose death rather than submit to\nthe destruction of passion which blinded High Lord Kevin and brought the\nDesecration. Come, can you believe that Lord Mhoram will ever despair? That is\nthe essence of the Oath of Peace. He will never despair, nor ever do what\ndespair commands-murder, desecrate, destroy. And he will never falter, because\nhis Lordship, his service to the Land, will sustain him. Service enables\nservice.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;That's not the same thing as\nhope.&quot; With the Giant, Covenant moved out of Manhome to stand in, the\nsunny fiat. The bright light made him duck his head, and as he did so he\nnoticed again the moss stains which</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>charted his robe. Abruptly, he\nlooked back into the cave. There the greenery was arranged among the columbines\nto resemble moss lines on white samite.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>He stifled a groan. As if he were\narticulating a principle, he said, &quot;All you need to avoid despair is\nirremediable stupidity or unlimited stubbornness.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;No,&quot; insisted\nFoamfollower. &quot;The Lords are not stupid. Look at the Land.&quot; He\ngestured broadly with his arm as if he expected Covenant to view the whole\ncountry from border to border.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant's gaze did not go so far.\nBut he looked blinking beyond the green flat toward the Plains. He heard the\ndistant whistles of the Bloodguard call to the Ranyhyn, and the nickering\nanswer. He noticed the fond wonder of the Winhomes who came out of the cave\nbecause they were too eager to wait in Manhome until the Ranyhyn appeared.\nAfter a moment, he said, &quot;In other words, hope comes from the power of\nwhat you serve, not from yourself. Hellfire, Giant-you forget who I am.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Do I?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Anyway, what makes you such\nan expert on hope? I don't see that you've got anything to despair about.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;No?&quot; The Giant's lips\nsmiled, but his eyes were hard under his buttressed brows, and his forehead's\nscar shone vividly. &quot;Do you forget that I have learned to hate? Do- But\nlet that pass. How if I tell you tha I serve you? I, Saltheart Foamfollower,\nGiant of Seareach and legate of my people?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant heard echoes in the\nquestion, like the distant wrack of timbers barely perceived through a high,\nsilent wind, and he recoiled. &quot;Don't talk like a damned mystic. Say\nsomething I can understand.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Foamfollower reached down to touch\nCovenant's chest with one heavy finger, as if he marked a spot on Covenant's\nmapped robe. &quot;Unbeliever, you hold the fate of the Land in your hands.\nSoulcrusher moves against the Lords at the very time when our dreams of Home\nhave been renewed. Must I explain that you have the power to save us, or orphan\nus until we share whatever doom awaits the Land?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Hellfire!&quot; Covenant\nsnapped. &quot;How many times have I told you that I'm a leper? It's all a\nmistake. Foul's playing tricks on us.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The Giant responded simply and\nquietly. &quot;Then are you so surprised to learn that I have been thinking\nabout hope?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant met Foamfollower's eyes\nunder the scarred overhang of his forehead. The Giant watched him as if the\nhope of the Unhomed were a sinking ship, and Covenant ached with the sense of\nhis own helplessness to save that hope. But then Foamfollower said as if he\nwere coming to Covenant's rescue, &quot;Be not concerned, my friend. This tale\nis yet too brief for any of us to guess its ending. As you say, I have spent\ntoo much time with hastening humans. My people would laugh greatly to see me-a\nGiant who has not patience enough for a long story. And the Lords contain much\nwhich may yet surprise Soulcrusher. Be of good heart. It may be that you and I\nhave already shared our portion of the terrible purpose of these times.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Gruffly, Covenant said,\n&quot;Giant, you talk too much.&quot; Foamfollower's capacity for gentleness\nsurpassed him. Muttering, Hellfire, to himself, he turned away, went in search\nof his staff and knife. He could hear the noises of preparation from beyond the\nflat; and in the village the Winhomes were busy packing food in saddlebags. The\ncompany was readying itself, and he did not want to be behind-hand. He found\nhis</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>staff and knife with the bundle of\nhis clothes laid out on a slab of stone amid the flowers, as if on display.\nThen he got a flustered, eager Winhome to provide him with water, soap, and a\nmirror. He felt that he owed himself a shave.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>But when he had set the mirror so\nthat he could use it, and had doused his face in water, he found Pietten\nstanding solemnly in front of him; and in the mirror he saw that Llaura was\nbehind him. Pietten stared at him as if the Unbeliever were as intangible as a\nwisp of smoke. And Llaura's face seemed tight, as if she were forcing herself\nto do something she disliked. She pushed her hand unhappily through her hair,\nthen said, &quot;You asked the Ramen to make a home for us here.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>He shrugged. &quot;So did\nFoamfollower.&quot; &quot;Why?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>His hearing picked out whole\nspeeches of meaning behind her question. She held his gaze in the mirror, and\nhe saw the memory of a burning tree in her eyes. He asked carefully, &quot;Do\nyou really think you might get a chance to hit back at Foul? Or be able to use\nit if you got it?&quot; He looked away at Pietten. &quot;Leave to Mhoram and\nProthall. You can trust them.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Of course.&quot; Her tone\nsaid as clearly as words that she was incapable of distrusting the Lords.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Then take the job you\nalready have. Here's Pietten. Think about what's going to happen to him-more of\nwhat you've already been through. He needs help.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Pietten yawned as if he were awake\npast his bedtime, and said, &quot;They hate you.&quot; He sounded as sober as\nan executioner.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;How?&quot; Llaura returned\ndefiantly. &quot;Have you observed him? Have you seen how he sits awake at\nnight? Have you seen how his eyes devour the moon? Have you seen his relish for\nthe taste of blood? He is no child-no more.&quot; She spoke as if Pietten were\nnot there listening to her, and Pietten listened as if she were reciting some\nformula of no importance. &quot;He is treachery concealed in a child's form.\nHow can I help Covenant wet his face again and began lathering soap. He could\nfeel Llaura's presence bearing on the back of his neck as he rubbed lather into\nhis beard. Finally, he muttered, &quot;Try the Ranyhyn. He likes them.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>When she reached over him to take\nPietten's hand and draw the child away, Covenant sighed and set the knife to\nhis beard. His hand was unsteady; he had visions of cutting himself. But the\nblade moved over his skin as smoothly as if it could remember that Atiaran had\nrefused to injure him.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>By the time he was done, the\ncompany had gathered outside Manhome. He hurried out to join the riders as if\nhe feared that the Quest would leave without him.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The last adjustments of saddles\nand saddlebags were in progress, and shortly Covenant stood beside Dura.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The condition of the horses\nsurprised him. They all gleamed with good grooming, and looked as well-fed and\nrested as if they had been under the care of the Ramen since the middle of\nspring. Some of the Eoman mounts which had been most exhausted were now pawing\nthe ground and shaking their manes eagerly.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The whole company seemed to have\nforgotten where they were going. The warriors were laughing together. Old\nBirinair clucked and scolded over the way the Ramen handled his lillianrill\nbrands. He treated the Ramen like spoiled children, and appeared to enjoy\nhimself almost too much to hide it behind his dignity. Mhoram sat smiling\nbroadly on Hynaril. And High Lord Prothall stood relaxed by his mount as if he\nhad shed years of care. Only the Bloodguard, already mounted and waiting on\ntheir Ranyhyn, remained stern.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The company's good spirits\ndisturbed Covenant like a concealed threat. He understood that it arose in part\nfrom rest and reassurance. But he felt sure that it also arose from his meeting\nwith the Ranyhyn. Like the Ramen, the warriors had been impressed; their desire\nto see in him a new Berek had been vindicated. The white gold wielder had shown\nhimself to be a man of consequence.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The Ranyhyn were terrified! he\nsnapped to himself. They saw Foul's hold on me, and they were terrified. But he\ndid not remonstrate aloud. He had made a promise of forbearance in return for\nhis survival. Despite the tacit dishonesty of allowing his companions to\nbelieve what they wished of him, he held himself still.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>As the riders laughed and joked,\nManethrall Lithe came to stand before them, followed by several other\nManethralls and a large group of Cords. When she had the company's attention,\nshe said, &quot;The Lords have asked for the help of the Ramen in their fight\nagainst Fangthane the Render. The Ramen serve the Ranyhyn. We do not leave the\nPlains of Ra. That is life, and it is good-we ask for nothing else until the\nend, when all the Earth is Andelain, and man and Ranyhyn live together in peace\nwithout wolves or hunger. But we must aid the foes of Fangthane as we can. This\nwe will do. I will go with you. My Cords will go with you if they choose. We\nwill care for your horses on the way. And when you leave them to seek\nFangthane's hiding in the ground, we will keep them safe. Lords, accept this\nservice as honor among friends and loyalty among allies.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>At once, the Cords Hurn, Thew,\nGrace, and Rustah stepped forward and avowed their willingness to go wherever\nManethrall Lithe would lead them.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Prothall bowed to Lithe in the\nRamen fashion. &quot;The service you offer is great. We know that your hearts\nare with the Ranyhyn. As friends we would refuse this honor if our need as\nallies were not so great. The doom of these times compels us to refuse no aid\nor succor. Be welcome among us. Your hunter skill will greatly ease the hazards\nof our way. We hope to do you honor in return-if we survive our Quest.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Kill Fangthane,&quot; said\nLithe. &quot;That will do us honor enough to the end of our days.&quot; She\nreturned Prothall's bow, and all the assembled Ramen joined her.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Then the High Lord spoke to his\ncompanions. In a moment, the Quest for the Staff of Law was mounted and ready\nto ride. Led by Manethrall Lithe and her Cords, the company cantered away from\nManhome as if in the village of the Ramen they had found abundant courage.<br\nclear=all style='page-break-before:always'>\n</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><a name=\"_Toc370739026\"><span class=Heading1Char><span\nstyle='font-size:16.0pt;line-height:105%'>TWENTY-ONE: Treacher's Gorge</span></span></a></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>They crossed the Plains northward\nin confidence and good spirits. No danger or report of danger appeared anywhere\nalong their way. And the Ranyhyn rode the grasslands like live blazonry,\nchallenges uttered in flesh. Foamfollower told gay tales as if he wished to\nshow that he had reached the end of a passing travail.. Quaan and his warriors\nresponded with ripostes and jests. And the Ramen entertained them with displays\nof hunting skill. The company rode late into the first night, in defiance of\nthe dismal moon. And the second night, they camped on the south bank of\nRoamsedge Ford.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>But early the next morning they\ncrossed the Ford and turned northeast up a broad way between the Roamsedge and\nMorinmoss. By mid-afternoon, they reached the eastmost edge of the Forest. From\nthere, the Roamsedge, the northern border of the Plains, swung more directly\neastward, and the company went on northeast, away from both Morinmoss and the\nPlains of Ra. That night, they slept on the edge of a stark, unfriendly\nflatland where no people lived and few willingly traveled. The whole region\nnorth of them was cut and scarred and darkened like an ancient battleground, a\nhuge field that had been ruined by the shedding of too much blood. Scrub grass,\nstunted trees, and a few scattered aliantha took only slight hold on the\nuncompromising waste. The company was due south of Mount Thunder.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>As the Quest angled northeastward\nacross this land, Mhoram told Covenant some of its history. It spread east to\nLandsdrop, and formed the natural front of attack for Lord Foul's armies in the\nancient wars. From the Fall of the River Landrider to Mount Thunder was open\nterrain along the great cliff of Landsdrop. The hordes issuing from Foul's\nCreche could ascend in scores of places to bring battle to the Upper Land. So\nit was that the first great battles in all the Land's wars against the Despiser\noccurred across this ravaged plain. Age after age, the defenders strove to halt\nLord Foul at Landsdrop, and failed because they could not block all the ways up\nfrom the Spoiled Plains and Sarangrave Flat. Then Lord Foul's armies passed\nwestward along the Mithil, and struck deep into the Center Plains. In the last\nwar, before Kevin Landwaster had been finally driven to invoke the Ritual of\nDesecration, Lord Foul had crushed through the heart of the Center Plains, and\nhad turned north to force the Lords to their final battle at Kurash Plenethor,\nnow named Trothgard.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>In the presence of so much old\ndeath, the riders did not travel loudly. But they sang songs during the first\nfew days, and several times they returned to the legend telling of Berek\nHalfhand and the Fire-Lions of Mount Thunder. On this wilderland Berek had\nfought, suffering the deaths of his friends and the loss of his fingers in\nbattle. Here he had met despair, and had fled to the slopes of Gravin Threndor,\nthe Peak of the Fire-Lions. And there he had found both Earthfriendship and\nEarthpower. It was a comforting song,</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>and the riders sang its refrain\ntogether as if they sought to make it true for themselves:</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Berek!

Help and heal!</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Cleanse the Land from bloody death\nand woel They needed its comfort. The hard-reft and harrowed warland seemed to\nsay that Berek's victory was an illusion-that all his Earthfriendship and his\nStaff of Law and his lineage of Lords, his mighty works and the works of his\ndescendants, amounted to so much scrub grass and charred rock and dust-that the\ntrue</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>history of the Land was written\nhere, in the bare topsoil and stone which lay like a litter of graves from the\nPlains of Ra to Mount Thunder, from Andelain to Landsdrop.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The atmosphere of the region\nagitated Foamfollower. He strode at Covenant's side with an air of concealed\nurgency, as if he were repressing a desire to break into a run. And he talked\nincessantly, striving to buoy up his spirits with a constant stream of stories\nand legends and songs. At first, his efforts pleased the riders, appeased their\ndeepening, hungry gloom like treasure-berries of entertainment. But the\nQuesters were on their way toward the bleak, black prospect of Drool Rockworm,\ncrouched like a bane in the catacombs of Mount Thunder. By the fourth day from\nRoamsedge Ford, Covenant felt that he was drowning in Giantish talk; and the\nvoices of the warriors when they sang sounded more pleading than confident-like\nwhistling against inexorable night.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>With the Ramen to help him,\nProthall found rapid ways over the rough terrain. Long after sunset on that\nfourth day when the growing moon stood high and baleful in the night sky-the\nQuest made a weary camp on the edge of Landsdrop.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The next dawn, Covenant resisted\nthe temptation to go and look over the great cliff. He wanted to catch a\nglimpse of the Lower Land, of the Spoiled Plains and Sarangrave Flat-regions\nwhich had filled Foamfollower's talk in the past days. But he had no intention\nof exposing himself to an attack of vertigo. The fragile stability of his\nbargain did not cover gratuitous risks. So he remained in the camp when most of\nhis companions went to gaze out over Landsdrop. But later, as the company rode\nnorth within a stone's throw of the edge, he asked Lord Mhoram to tell him\nabout the great cliff.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Ah, Landsdrop,&quot; Mhoram\nresponded quietly. &quot;There is talk, unfounded even in the oldest legends,\nthat the cleft of Landsdrop was caused by the sacrilege which buried immense banes\nunder Mount Thunder's roots. In a cataclysm that shook its very heart, the\nEarth heaved with revulsion at the evils it was forced to contain. And the\nforce of that dismay broke the Upper Land from the Lower, lifted it toward the\nsky. So this cliff reaches from deep in the Southron Range, past the Fall of\nthe River Landrider, through the heart of Mount Thunder, at least half a\nthousand leagues into the mapless winter of the Northron Climbs.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>It varies in height from place to\nplace. But it stands across all the Land, and does not allow us to\nforget.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The Lord's rough voice only\nsharpened Covenant's anxiety. As the company rode, he held his gaze away to the\nwest, trusting the wilderland to anchor him against his instinctive fear of\nheights.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Before noon, the weather changed.\nWithout warning, a sharp wind bristling with grim, preternatural associations\nsprang out of the north. In moments, black clouds seethed across the sky.\nLightning ripped the air; thunder pounded like a crushing of boulders. Then,\nout of the bawling sky, rain struck like a paroxysm of rage -hit with savage\nforce until it stung. The horses lowered their heads as if they were wincing.\nTorrents battered the riders, drenched, blinded them. Manethrall Lithe sent her\nCords scouting ahead to keep the company from plunging over Landsdrop. Prothall\nraised his staff with bright fire flaring at its tip to help keep his\ncompanions from losing each other. They huddled together, and the Bloodguard\npositioned the Ranyhyn around them to bear the brunt of the attack.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>In the white revelations of the\nlightning, Prothall's flare appeared dim and frail, and thunder detonated\nhugely over it as if exploding at the touch of folly. Covenant crouched low on\nDura's back, flinched away from the lightning as if the sky were stone which\nthe thunder shattered. He could not see the Cords, did not know what was\nhappening around him; he was constantly afraid that Dura's next step would take\nhim over the cliff. He clenched his eyes to Prothall's flame as if it could\nkeep him from being lost.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The skill and simple toughness of\nthe Ramen pre-` served the company, kept it moving toward Mount Thunder. But\nthe journey seemed like wandering in the collapse of the heavens. The riders\ncould only be</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>sure of their direction because\nthey were always forcing their way into the maw of the storm. The wind flailed\nthe rain at their faces until their eyes felt lacerated and their cheeks\nshredded. And the cold drenching stiffened their limbs, paralyzed them slowly\nlike the rigor of death. But they went on as if they were trying to beat down a\nwall of stone with their foreheads.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>For two full days, they pushed\nonward-felt themselves crumbling under the onslaught of the rain. But they knew\nneither day nor night, knew nothing but one continuous, pummeling, dark,\nsavage, implacable storm. They rode until they were exhausted-rested on their\nfeet knee-deep in water and mud, gripping the reins of their horses-ate sopping\nmorsels of food half warmed by lillianrill fires which Birinair struggled to\nkeep half alive-counted themselves to be sure no one had been lost-and rode\nagain until they were forced by exhaustion to stop again. At times, they felt\nthat Prothall's wan blue flame alone sustained them. Then Lord Mhoram moved\namong the company. In the lurid lightning, his face appeared awash with water\nlike a foundering wreck; but he went to each Quester, shouted through the howl\nof wind and rain, the devastating thunder, &quot;Drool-storm-for us! But he\nmistaken! Main force-passes-west! Take heard Augurs-for us!&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant was too worn and cold to\nrespond. But he heard the generous courage behind Mhoram's words. When the\ncompany started forward again, he squinted ahead toward Prothall's flame as if\nhe were peering into a mystery.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The struggle went on, prolonged\nitself far beyond the point where it felt unendurable. In time, endurance\nitself became abstract-a mere concept, too impalpable to carry conviction. The\nlash and riot of the storm reduced the riders to raw, quivering flesh hardly\nable to cling to their mounts. But Prothall's fire burned on. At each new flash\nand blast, Covenant reeled in his seat. He wanted nothing in life but a chance\nto lie down in the mud. But Prothall's fire burned on. It was like a manacle,\nemprisoning the riders, dragging them forward. In the imminent madness of the\ntorrents, Covenant gritted his gaze as if that manacle were precious to him.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Then they passed the boundary. It\nwas as abrupt as if the wall against which they had thrown themselves like\nusurped titans had suddenly fallen into mud. Within ten stumbling heartbeats,\nthe end of the storm blew over them, and they stood gasping in a sun-bright\nnoon. They could hear the tumult rushing blindly away. Around them were the\nremains of the deluge-broken pools and streams and fens, thick mud like\nwreckage on the battle plain. And before them stood the great ravaged head of\nMount Thunder: Gravin Threndor, Peak of the Fire-Lions.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>For a long moment, it held them\nlike an aegis of silence-grim, grave and august, like an outcropping of the\nEarth's heart. The Peak was north and slightly west of them. Taller than\nKevin's Watch above the Upper Land, it seemed to kneel on the edge of the\nSarangrave, with its elbows braced on the plateau and its head high over the\ncliff, fronting the sky in a strange attitude of pride and prayer; and it rose\ntwelve thousand feet over the Defiles Course, which flowed eastward from its\nfeet. Its sides from its crumpled foothills to the raw rock of its crown were\nbare, not cloaked or defended from storms, snows, besieging time by any trees\nor grasses, but instead wearing sheer, fragmented cliffs like facets, some as\nblack as obsidian and others as gray as the ash of a granite fire-as if the\nstone of the Mount were too thick, too charged with power, to bear any gentle\nkind of life.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>There, deep in the hulky chest of\nthe mountain, was the destination of the Quest: Kiril Threndor, Heart of\nThunder.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>They were still ten leagues from\nthe Peak, but the distance was deceptive. Already that scarred visage dominated\nthe northern horizon; it confronted them over the rift of Landsdrop like an\nirrefusable demand. Mount Thunder! There Berek Halfhand had found his great\nrevelation. There the Quest for the Staff of</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Law hoped to regain the future of\nthe Land. And there Thomas Covenant sought release from the impossibility of\nhis dreams. The company stared at the upraised rock as if it searched their\nhearts, asked them questions which they could not answer.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Then Quaan grinned fiercely, and\nsaid, &quot;At least now we have been washed clean enough for such work.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>That incongruity cracked the\ntrance which held the riders. Several of the warriors burst into laughter as if\nrecoiling from the strain of the past two days, and most of the others\nchuckled, daring Drool or any enemy to believe that the storm had weakened\nthem. Though nearly prostrated by the exertion of finding a path through the\ntorrents on foot, the Ramen laughed as well, sharing a humor they did not fully\nunderstand.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Only Foamfollower did not respond.\nHis eyes were fixed on Mount Thunder, and his brows overhung his gaze as if\nshielding it from something too bright or hot to be beheld directly.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The Questers found a relatively\ndry hillock on which to rest and eat, and feed their mounts; and Foamfollower\nwent with them absently. While the company made itself as comfortable as\npossible for a time, he stood apart and gazed at the mountain as if he were\nreading secrets in its scored crevices and cliffs. Softly he sang to himself:</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Now we are Unhomed, bereft of root\nand kith and kin. From other mysteries of delight,</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>we set our sails to resail our\ntrack;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>but the winds of life blew not the\nway we chose, and the land beyond the Sea was lost.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>High Lord Prothall let the company\nrest for as long as he dared in the open plain. Then he moved on again for the\nremainder of the afternoon, clinging to the edge of Landsdrop as if it were his\nonly hope. Before the storm, Covenant had learned that the sole known entrance\nto the catacombs of Mount Thunder was through the western chasm of the\nSoulsease-Treacher's Gorge, the rocky maw which swallowed the river, only to\nspit it out again eastward on the Lower Land, transmogrified by hidden\nturbulent depths into the Defiles Course, a stream gray with the sludge and\nwaste of the Wightwarrens. So Prothall's hope lay in his southeastern approach.\nHe believed that by reaching Mount Thunder on the south and moving toward\nTreacher's Gorge from the east, the company could arrive unseen and unexpected\nat the Gorge's western exposure. But he took no unnecessary risks. Gravin\nThrendor stood perilously large against the sky, and seemed already to lean\nlooming toward the company as if the Peak itself were bent to the shape of\nDrool's malice. He urged the tired Ramen to their best cunning in choosing a\nway along Landsdrop; and he kept the riders moving until after the sun had set.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>But all the time he rode slumped\nagedly in his saddle, with his head bowed as if he were readying his</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>neck for the stroke of an ax. He\nseemed to have spent all his strength in pulling his companions through the\nstorm. Whenever he spoke, his long years rattled in his throat.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The next morning, the sun came up\nlike a wound into ashen skies. Gray clouds overhung the earth, and a shuddering\nwind fell like a groan from the slopes of Mount Thunder. Across the wasteland,\nthe pools of rainwater began to stagnate, as if the ground refused to drink the\nmoisture, leaving it to rot instead. And as they prepared to ride, the Questers\nheard a low rumble like the march of drums- deep in the rock. They could feel\nthe throb in their feet, in their knee joints.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>It was the beat of mustering war.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The High Lord answered as if it\nwere a challenge. &quot;Melenkurion!&quot; he called clearly. &quot;Arise,\nchampions of the Land! I hear the drums of the Earth! This is the great work of\nour time!&quot; He swung onto his horse with his blue robe fluttering.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Warhaft Quaan responded with a\ncheer, &quot;Hail, High Lord Prothall! We are proud to follow!&quot; Prothall's\nshoulders squared. His horse lifted its ears, raised its head, took a few\nprancing steps as grandly as a Ranyhyn. The Ranyhyn nickered humorously at the\nsight, and the company rode after Prothall boldly, as if the spirits of the\nancient Lords were in them.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>They made their way to the slopes\nof Mount Thunder through the constant buried rumble of the drums. As they found\na path across the thickening rubble which surrounded the mountain, the booming\nsubterreanean call accompanied them like an exhalation of Despite. But when\nthey started up the first battered sides of the Peak, they forgot the drums;\nthey had to concentrate on the climb. The foothills were like a gnarled stone\nmantle which Mount Thunder had shrugged from its shoulders in ages long past,\nand the way, westward over the slopes was hard. Time and again, the riders were\nforced to dismount to lead their mounts down tricky hills or over gray piles of\ntumbled, ashen rock. The difficulty of the terrain made their progress slow,\ndespite all the Ramen could do to search out the easiest trails. The Peak\nseemed to lean gravely over them as if watching their small struggles. And down\nonto them from the towering cliffs came a chilling wind, as cold as winter.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>At noon, Prothall halted in a deep\ngully which ran down the mountainside like a cut. There the company rested and\nate. When they were not moving, they could hear the drums clearly, and the cold\nwind seemed to pounce on them from the cliffs above. They sat in the straight\nlight of the sun and shivered-some at the cold, others at the drums.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>During the halt, Mhoram came over\nto Covenant and suggested that they climb a way up the gully together. Covenant\nnodded; he was glad to keep himself busy. He followed the Lord up the cut's\ncontorted spine until they reached a break in its west wall. Mhoram entered the\nbreak; and when Covenant stepped in behind the Lord, he got a broad, sudden\nview of Andelain.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>From the altitude of the break\nbetween the stone walls he felt that he was looking down over Andelain from a\nwindow in the side of Mount Thunder. The Hills lay richly over all the western\nhorizon, and their beauty took his breath away. He stared hungrily with a\nfeeling of stasis, of perfect pause in his chest, like a quick grip of\neternity. The lush, clear health of Andelain shone like a country of stars\ndespite the gray skies and the dull battle-roll. He felt obscurely unwilling to\nbreathe, to break the trance, but after a moment his lungs began to hurt for\nair.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Here is the Land,&quot;\nMhoram whispered. &quot;Grim, powerful Mount Thunder above us. The darkest\nbanes and secrets of the Earth in the catacombs beneath our feet. The\nbattleground behind. Sarangrave Flat below. And there-priceless Andelain, the\nbeauty of life. Yes. This is the heart of the Land.&quot; He stood reverently,\nas if he felt himself to be in an august presence.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant looked at him. &quot;So\nyou brought me up here to convince me that this is worth fighting for.&quot;\nHis mouth twisted on the bitter taste of shame. &quot;You want something from\nme-some declaration of allegiance. Before you have to face Drool.&quot; The\nCavewights he had slain lay hard and cold in his memory.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Of course,&quot; the Lord replied.\n&quot;But it is the Land itself which asks for your allegiance.&quot; Then he\nsaid with sudden intensity, &quot;Behold, Thomas Covenant. Use your eyes. Look\nupon it all. Look and listen hear the drums. And hear me. This is the heart of\nthe Land. It is not the home of the Despiser. He has no place here. Oh, he\ndesires the power of the banes, but his home is in Foul's Creche-not here. He\nhas not depth or sternness or beauty enough for this place, and when he works\nhere it is through ur-viles or Cavewights. Do you see?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;I see.&quot; Covenant met\nthe Lord's gaze flatly. &quot;I've already made my bargain-my `peace,' if you\nwant to call it that. I'm not going to do any more killing.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Your `peace'?&quot; Mhoram\nechoed in a complex tone. Slowly, the danger dimmed in his eyes. &quot;Well, you\nmust pardon me. In times of trouble, some Lords behave strangely.&quot; He\npassed Covenant and started back down the gully.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant remained in the window\nfor a moment, watching Mhoram go. He had not missed the Lord's oblique\nreference to Kevin; but he wondered what kinship Mhoram saw between himself and\nthe Landwaster. Did the Lord believe himself capable of that kind of despair?</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Muttering silently, Covenant\nreturned to the company. He saw a measuring look in the eyes of the warriors;\nthey were trying to assess what had occurred between him and Lord Mhoram. But\nhe did not care what portents they read into him. When the company moved on, he\nled Dura up the side of the gully, blank to the shifting shale which more than\nonce dropped him to his hands and knees, scratching and bruising him\ndangerously. He was thinking about the Celebration of Spring, about the battle\nof Soaring Woodhelven, about children and Llaura and Pietten and Atiaran and\nthe nameless Unfettered One and Lena and Triock and the warrior who had died\ndefending him-thinking, and striving to tell himself that his bargain was\nsecure, that he was not angry enough to risk fighting again.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>That afternoon, the company\nstruggled on over the arduous ground, drawing slowly higher as they worked\nwestward. They caught no glimpses of their destination. Even when the sun fell\nlow in the sky, and the roar of waters became a distinct accompaniment to the\nburied beat of the drums, they were still not able to see the Gorge. But then\nthey entered a sheer, sheltered ravine in the mountainside. From this ravine a\nrift too narrow for the horses angled away into the rock, and through it they\ncould hear a snarling current. In the ravine the riders left their mounts under\nthe care of the Cords. They went ahead on foot down the rift as it curved into\nthe mountain and then broke out of the cliff no more than a hundred feet\ndirectly above Treacher's Gorge.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>They no longer heard the drums;\nthe tumult of the river smothered every sound but their own half-shouts. The\nwalls of the chasm were high and sheer, blocking the horizon on either side.\nBut through the spray that covered them like a mist, they could see the Gorge\nitself-the tight rock channel constricting the river until it appeared to\nscream, and the wild, white, sunset flame-plumed water thrashing as if it\nfought against its own frantic rush. From nearly a league away to the west,,\nthe river came writhing down the Gorge, and sped below the company into the\nguts of the mountain as if sucked into an abyss. Above</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>the Gorge, the setting sun hung\nnear the horizon like a ball of blood in the leaden sky; and the light gave a\nshade of fire to the few hardy trees that clung to the rims of the chasm as if\nrooted by duty. But within Treacher's Gorge was nothing but spray and sheer\nstone walls and tortured waters.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The roar inundated Covenant's\nears, and the mist wet rock seemed to slip under his feet. For an instant, the\ncliffs reeled; he could feel the maw of Mount Thunder gaping for him. Then he\nsnatched himself back into the rift, stood with his back pressed against the\nrock, hugged his chest and fought not to gasp.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>There was activity around him. He\nheard shouts of surprise and fear from the warriors at the end of the rift,\nheard Foamfollower's strangled howl. But he did not move. He clenched himself\nagainst the rock in the mist and roar of the river until his knees steadied,\nand the scream of slippage eased in his feet. Only then did he go to find out\nwhat caused the distress of his companions. He kept one hand braced on the wall\nand moved the other from shoulder to shoulder among the company as he went\nforward.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Between Covenant and the cliff,\nFoamfollower struggled. Two Bloodguard clung to his arms, and he battered them\nagainst the sides of the rift, hissing rapaciously, &quot;Release me! Release-!\nI want them!&quot; As if he wished to leap down into the Gorge.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;No!&quot; Abruptly, Prothall\nstood before the Giant. The backlight of the sunset dimmed his face as he stood\nsilhouetted against the glow with his arms wide and his staff held high. He was\nold, and only half the Giant's size. But the orangered fire seemed to expand\nhim, make him taller, more full of authority. &quot;Rockbrother! Master\nyourself! By the Seven! Do you rave?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>At that, Foamfollower threw off\nthe Bloodguard. He caught the front of Prothall's robe, heaved the High Lord\ninto the air, pinned him against the wall. Into his face, the Giant wheezed as\nif he were choking with rage, &quot;Rave? Do you accuse me?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The Bloodguard sprang toward\nFoamfollower. But a shout from Mhoram stopped them. Prothall hung clamped\nagainst the stone like a handful of old rags, but his eyes did not flinch. He\nrepeated, &quot;Do you rave?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>For one horrible moment,\nFoamfollower held the High Lord as if he meant to murder him with one huge\nsqueeze of his fist. Covenant tried to think of something to say, some way to\nintervene, but could not. He had no conception of what had happened to\nFoamfollower.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Then from behind Covenant First\nMark Tuvor said clearly, &quot;A Raver? In one of the Seareach Giants?\nImpossible.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>As if impaled by Tuvor's\nassertion, Foamfollower broke into a convulsion of coughing. The violence of\nhis reaction knotted his gnarled frame. He lowered Prothall, then collapsed\nbackward, falling with a thud against the opposite wall. Slowly, his paroxysm\nchanged into a low chuckle like the glee of hysteria.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Heard through the groaning of the\nriver, that sound made Covenant's skin crawl like a slimy caress. He could not\nabide it. Driven by a need to learn what had befallen Foamfollower, he moved\nforward to look into the Gorge.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>There, braced now against his\nvertigo and the inundation of the river roar, he saw what had ignited\nFoamfollower. Ah, Giant! he groaned. To kill-! Below him and barely twenty feet\nabove the level of the river was a narrow roadway like a ledge in the south wall\nof the Gorge. And along the roadway to the beat of unheard drums marched an\narmy of Cavewights out of Mount Thunder. Captained by a wedge of urviles, file\nafter file of the gangrel creatures jerked out of the mountain and tramped\nalong the ledge with</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>a glare of lust in their laval\neyes. Thousands had already left their Wightwarrens; and behind them the files\ncontinued as if Mount Thunder were spewing all the hordes of its inhabiting\nvermin onto the undefended Earth.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Foamfollower!</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>For a moment, Covenant's heart\nbeat to the rhythm of the Giant's pain. He could not bear to think that\nFoamfollower and his people might lose their hope of Home because of creatures\nlike those. Is killing the only answer?</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Numbly, half blindly, he began\nlooking for the way in which Foamfollower had meant to reach the ledge and the\nCavewights.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>He found it easily enough; it\nlooked simple for anyone not timorous of heights. There was a rude, slick stair\ncut into the rock of the south wall from the rift down to the roadway. Opposite\nit were steps which went from the rift up to the top of the Gorge. They were as\ngray, spray-worn and old as native stone.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Lord Mhoram had come up behind\nCovenant. His voice reached dimly through the river roar. &quot;This is the\nancient Look of Treacher's Gorge. That part of the First Ward which tells of\nthis place is easily understood. It was formed for the watch and concealment of\nthe betrayers. For here at Treacher's Gorge, Lord Foul the Despiser revealed\nhis true self to High Lord Kevin. Here was struck the first blow of the open\nwar which ended in the Ritual of Desecration.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Before that time, Kevin\nLandwaster doubted Lord Foul without knowing why-for the Despiser had enacted\nno ill which Kevin could discover-and he showed trust for Lord Foul out of\nshame for his unworthy doubt. Then, through the Despiser's plotting, a message\ncame to the Council of Lords from the Demondim in Mount Thunder. The message\nasked the Lords to come to the Demondim loreworks, the spawning crypts where\nthe ur-viles were made, to meet with the loremasters, who claimed knowledge of\na secret power.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Clearly, Lord Foul intended\nfor Kevin to go to Mount Thunder. But the High Lord doubted, and did not go.\nThen he was ashamed of his doubt, and sent in his stead some of his truest\nfriends and strongest allies. So a high company of the Old Lords rafted as was\ntheir wont down the Soulsease through Andelain to Mount Thunder. And here, in\nthe roar and spray and ill of Treacher's Gorge, they were ambushed by ur-viles.\nThey were slaughtered, and their bodies sent to the abyss of the mountain. Then\nmarched armies like these out of the catacombs, and the Land was plunged all\nunready into war.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;That long conflict went on\nbattle after death littered battle without hope. High Lord Kevin fought\nbravely. But he had sent his friends into ambush. Soon he began his midnight\nmeetings with despair-and there was no hope.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The seductive, dizzy rush of the\nriver drained Covenant's resistance. Spray beaded on his face like sweat.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Foamfollower had wanted to do the\nsame thing leap into the writhing allure of the Gorge-fall on the Cavewights\nfrom ambush.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>With an effort that made him moan\nthrough his clenched teeth, Covenant backed away from the Look. Gripping\nhimself against the wall, he asked without apparent transition, &quot;Is he\nstill laughing?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Mhoram appeared to understand.\n&quot;No. Now he sits and quietly sings the song of the Unhomed, and gives no\nsign.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Foamfollower! Covenant breathed.\n&quot;Why did you stop the Bloodguard? He might've hurt Prothall.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The Lord turned his back on Treacher's\nGorge to face Covenant. &quot;Saltheart Foamfollower is my friend. How could I\ninterfere?&quot; A moment later, he added, &quot;The High Lord is not\ndefenseless.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant persisted. &quot;Maybe a\nRaver-&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;No.&quot; Mhoram's flat\nassertion acknowledged no doubt. &quot;Tuvor spoke truly. No Raver has the\nmight to master a Giant.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;But something&quot;-Covenant\ngroped-&quot;something is hurting him. He-he doesn't believe those omens. He\nthinks-Drool-or something-is going to prevent the Giants from going Home.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Mhoram's reply was so soft that\nCovenant was forced to read it on his crooked lips. &quot;So do I.&quot;\nFoamfollower!</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant looked down the rift at\nthe Giant. In the darkness Foamfollower sat like a lump of shale against one\nwall, singing quietly and staring at invisible visions on the stone before him.\nThe sight brought up a surge of sympathetic anger in Covenant, but he clamped\nit down, clutched his bargain. The walls of the rift leaned in toward him, like\nsuffocating fear, dark wings. He thrust himself past the Giant and out toward\nthe ravine.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Before long, the company gathered\nthere for supper. They ate by the light of one dim lillianrill torch; and when\nthe meal was done, they tried to get some sleep. Covenant felt that rest was\nimpossible; he sensed the army of Cavewights unrolling like a skein of\ndestruction for the weaving of the Land's death. But the ceaseless roar of the\nriver lulled him until he relaxed against the ground. He dozed slightly, with\nthe drums of war throbbing in the rock under him.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Later, he found himself sharply\nawake. The red moon had passed the crest of Mount Thunder, and now glared\nstraight down on the ravine. He guessed that midnight was past. At first, he\nthought that the moon had roused him with its nearly full stare. But then he\nrealized that the vibration of the drums was gone from the rock. He glanced\naround the camp, and saw Tuvor whispering with High Lord Prothall. The next\nmoment, Tuvor began waking the sleepers.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Soon the warriors were alert and\nready. Covenant had his knife in the belt of his robe, his staff in his hand.\nBirinair held aloft a rod with a small flame flickering from its tip, and in\nthat uncertain light Mhoram and Prothall stood together with Manethrall Lithe,\nWarhaft Quaan, and the First Mark. Dim shadows shifted like fear and resolution\nacross Prothall's face. His voice sounded weak with age as he said, &quot;Now\nis our last hour of open sky. The outpouring of Drool's army has ended. Those\nof us who will must go into the catacombs of Mount Thunder. We must take this\nchance to enter, while Drool's attention is still with his army-before he can\nperceive that we are not where he thinks us to be.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Now is the time for those\nwho would to lay down the Quest. There can be no retreat, or escape after\nfailure, in the Wightwarrens. The Quest has already been bravely served. None\nwho now lay it down need feel shame.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Carefully, Quaan said, &quot;Do\nyou turn back, High Lord?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Ah, no,&quot; sighed\nProthall. &quot;The hand of these times is upon me. I dare not falter.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Then Quaan replied, &quot;Can a\nEoman of the Warward of Lord's Keep turn back when the High Lord leads?\nNever!&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>And the Eoman echoed,\n&quot;Never!&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant wondered where\nFoamfollower was, what the Giant would do. For himself, he felt intuitively\nsure that he had no choice, that his dream would only release him by means of the\nStaff of Law. Or by death.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The next moment, Manethrall Lithe\nspoke to Prothall. Her head was back, and her slim form was primed as if she\nwere prepared to explode. &quot;I gave my word. Your horses will be tended. The\nCords will preserve them in hope of your return. But I-&quot; She shook her\nbound hair as if she were defying herself. &quot;I will go with you. Under the\nground.&quot; Prothall's protest she stopped with a sharp gesture. &quot;You\nset an example I must follow. How could I stand before a Ranyhyn again, if I\ncome so far only to turn away when the peril becomes great? And I feel\nsomething more. The Ramen know the sky, the open earth.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>We know air and grass. We do not\nlose our way in darkness-the Ranyhyn have taught our feet to be sure. I feel\nthat I will always know my way-outward. You may have need of me, though I am\nfar from the Plains of Ra, and from myself.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The shadows formed Prothall's face\ninto a grimace, but he responded quietly, &quot;I thank you, Manethrall. The\nRamen are brave friends of the Land.&quot; Casting his eyes over the whole\ncompany, he said, &quot;Come, then. The outcome of our Quest awaits. Whatever\nmay befall us-as long as there are people to sing, they will sing that in this\ndark hour the Land was well championed. Now be true to the last.&quot; Without\nwaiting for an answer, he went out of the bloody moonlight into the rift.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The warriors let Covenant follow\nbehind the two Lords as if according him a position of respect. Prothall and\nMhoram walked side by side; and when they neared the Look, Covenant could see\nfrom between them Foamfollower standing at the edge of the cliff. The Giant had\nhis palms braced above his head on either wall. His back was to the Lords; he\nstared into the bleak, blood-hued writhing of the river. His huge form was dark\nagainst the vermilion sky.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>When the Lords came near him, he\nsaid as if he were speaking back to them from the Gorge, &quot;I remain here.\nMy watch. I will guard you. Drool's army will not trap you in Mount Thunder\nwhile I live.&quot; A moment later, he added as if he had recognized the bottom\nof himself, &quot;From here I will not smell the Wightwarrens.&quot; But his\nnext words carried an echo of old Giantish humor. &quot;The catacombs were not\nmade to accommodate creatures the size of Giants.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;You choose well,&quot;\nmurmured Prothall. &quot;We need your protection. But do not remain here after\nthe full moon. If we do not return by that time, we are lost, and you must go\nto warn your people.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Foamfollower answered as if in\nreply to some other voice. &quot;Remember the Oath of Peace. In the maze where\nyou go, it is your lifeline. It preserves you against Soulcrusher's purposes,\nhidden and savage. Remember the Oath. It may be that hope misleads. But\nhate-hate corrupts. I have been too quick to hate. I become like what I\nabhor.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Have some respect for the\ntruth,&quot; Mhoram snapped. The sudden harshness of his tone startled\nCovenant. &quot;You are Saltheart Foamfollower of the Seareach Giants,\nRockbrother to the men of the Land. That name cannot be taken from you.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>But Covenant had heard no\nself-pity in the Giant's words-only recognition and sorrow. Foamfollower did\nnot speak again. He stood as still as the walls against which he braced\nhimself-stood like a statue carved to occupy the Look.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The Lords spent no more time with\nhim. Already the night was waning, and they wanted to enter the mountain before\ndaylight.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The Questers took positions.\nProthall, Birinair, and two Bloodguard followed First Mark Tuvor. Then came\nMhoram, Lithe, Bannor, Covenant, and Korik. Then came Warhaft Quaan, his\nfourteen warriors, and the last four Bloodguard.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>They were only twenty-nine against\nall of Drool Rockworm's unknown might.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>They strung a line of clingor from\nTuvor to the last Bloodguard. In single file, they started down the slick stair\ninto Treacher's Gorge.<br clear=all style='page-break-before:always'>\n</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><a name=\"_Toc370739027\"><span class=Heading1Char><span\nstyle='font-size:16.0pt;line-height:105%'>TWENTY-TWO: The Catacombs of Mount\nThunder</span></span></a></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Drool’s moon embittered the night\nlike a consummation of gall. Under it, the river thrashed and roared in\nTreacher's Gorge as if it were being crushed. Spray and slick-wet moss made the\nstair down from the Look as treacherous as a quagmire.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant bristled with\ntrepidations. At first, when his turn to begin the descent had come, his dread\nhad paralyzed him. But when Bannor had offered to carry him, he had found the\npride to make himself move. In addition to the clingor line, Bannor and Korik\nheld his staff like a railing for him. He went tortuously down into the Gorge\nas if he were striving to lock his feet on the stone of each step.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The stair dropped irregularly from\nthe cliff into the wall of the Gorge. Soon the company was creeping into the\nloud chasm, led only by the light of Birinair's torch. The crimson froth of the\nriver seemed to leap up at them like a hungry plague as they neared the\nroadway. Each step was slicker than the one before. Behind him, Covenant heard\na gasp as one of the warriors slipped. The low cry carried terror like the\nquarrel of a crossbow. But the Bloodguard anchoring the line were secure; the\nwarrior quickly regained his footing.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The descent dragged on. Covenant's\nankles began to ache with the increasing uncertainty of his feet. He tried to\nthink his soles into the rock, make them part of the stone through sheer\nconcentration. And he gripped his staff until his palms were so slick with\nsweat that the wood seemed to be pulling away from him. His knees started to\nquiver.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>But Bannor and Korik upheld him.\nThe distance to the roadway shrank. After several long, bad moments, the threat\nof panic receded.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Then he reached the comparative\nsafety of the ledge. He stood in the midst of the company between the Gorge\nwall and the channel of the river. Above them, the slash of sky had begun to\nturn gray, but that</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>lightening only emphasized the\ndarkness of the Gorge. Birinair's lone torch flickered as if it were lost in a\nwilderland.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The Questers had to yell to make\nthemselves understood over the tumult of the current. Briskly, Quaan gave\nmarching orders to his Eoman. The warriors checked over their weapons. With a\nfew gestures and a slight nod or two, Tuvor made his last arrangements with the\nBloodguard. Covenant gripped his staff, and assured himself of his Stonedownor\nknife-Atiaran's knife. He had a vague impression that he had forgotten\nsomething. But before he could try to think what it was, he was distracted by\nshouts.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Old Birinair was yelling at High\nLord Prothall. For once, the Hearthrall seemed careless of his gruff dignity.\nAgainst the roar of the river, he thrust his seamed and quivering face at\nProthall, and barked, &quot;You cannot! The risk!&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Prothall shook his head\nnegatively. &quot;You cannot lead! Allow me!&quot; Again, Prothall silently\nrefused.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Of course!&quot; shouted\nBirinair, struggling to make his determination carry over the howl of water.\n&quot;You must not! I can! I know the ways! Of course. Are you alone old enough\nto study? I know the old maps. No fool, you know-if I look old, and&quot;-he\nfaltered momentarily-&quot;and useless. You must allow me!&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Prothall strove to shout without\nsounding angry. &quot;Time is short! We must not delay. Birinair, old friend, I\ncannot put the first risk of this Quest onto another. It is my place.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Fool!&quot; spat Birinair,\ndaring any insolence to gain his point. &quot;How will you see?&quot;\n&quot;See?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Of course!&quot; The\nHearthrall quivered with sarcasm.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;You will go before! Risk\nall! Light the way with Lords-fire! Fool! Drool will see you before you reach\nWarrenbridge!&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Prothall at last understood.\n&quot;Ah, that is true.&quot; He sagged as if the realization hurt him.\n&quot;Your light is quieter than mine. Drool will surely sense our coming if I\nmake use of my staff.&quot; Abruptly, he turned to one side, angry now.\n&quot;Tuvor!&quot; he commanded. &quot;Hearthrall Birinair leads! He will light\nour way in my place. Ward him well, Tuvor! Do not let this old friend suffer my\nperils.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Birinair drew himself up;\nrediscovering dignity in his responsibility. He extinguished the rod he\ncarried,</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>and gave it to a warrior to pack\naway with the rest of his brands. Then he stroked the end of his staff, and a\nflame sprang up there. With a brusque beckon, he raised his fire and started\nstiffly down the roadway toward the maw of Mount Thunder.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>At once, Terrel and Korik passed\nthe Hirebrand and took scouting positions twenty feet ahead of him. Two other\nBloodguard placed themselves just behind him; and after them went Prothall and\nMhoram together, then two more Bloodguard followed singly by Manethrall Lithe,\nCovenant, and Bannor. Next marched Quaan with his Eoman in files of three,\nleaving the last two Bloodguard to bring up the rear. In that formation, the\ncompany moved toward the entrance to the catacombs.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant looked upward briefly to\ntry to catch a last glimpse of Foamfollower in the Look. But he did not see the\nGiant; the Gorge was too full of darkness. And the roadway demanded his\nattention. He went into the rock under Foamfollower without any wave or sign of\nfarewell.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Thus the company strode away from\ndaylight-from sun and sky and open air and grass and possibility of retreat-and\ntook their Quest into the gullet of Mount Thunder.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant went into that demesne of\nnight as if into a nightmare. He was .not braced for the entrance to the\ncatacombs. He had approached it without fear; the relief of having survived the\ndescent from the Look had rendered him temporarily immune to panic. He had not\nsaid farewell to Foamfollower; he had forgotten something; but these pangs were\ndiffused by a sense of anticipation, a sense that his bargain would bring him out\nof the dream with his ability to endure intact.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>But the sky above-an openness of\nwhich he had hardly been aware-was cut off as if by an ax, and replaced by the\nhuge stone weight of the mountain, so heavy that its aura alone was crushing.\nIn his ears, its mass seemed to rumble like silent thunder. The river's roaring\nmounted in the gullet of the cave, adumbrated itself as if the constricted pain\nof the current were again constricted into keener and louder pain. The spray\nwas as thick as rain; ahead of the company, Birinair's flame burned dim and\npenumbral, nearly quenched by the wet air. And the surface of the roadway was\nhazardous, littered with holes and rocks and loose shale. Covenant strained his\nattention as if he were listening for a note of sense in the gibberish of his\nexperience, and under this alertness he wore his hope of escape like a buckler.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>In more ways than one, he felt\nthat it was his only protection. The company seemed pathetically weak,\ndefenseless against the dark-dwelling Cavewights and ur-viles. Stumbling\nthrough night broken only at the solitary point of Birinair's fire, he\npredicted that the company would be observed soon. Then a report would go to\nDrool, and the inner forces of the Wightwarrens would pour forth, and the army\nwould be recalled-what chance had Foamfollower against so many thousands of\nCavewights?-and the company would be crushed like a handful of presumptuous\nants. And in that moment of resolution or death would come his own rescue or\ndefeat. He could not envision any other outcome.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>With these thoughts, he walked as\nif he were listening for the downward rush of an avalanche.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>After some distance, he realized\nthat the sound of the river was changing. The roadway went inward almost\nhorizontally, but the river was falling into the depths of the rock. The\ncurrent was becoming a cataract, an abysmal plummet like a plunge into death.\nThe sound of it receded slowly as the river crashed farther and farther away\nfrom the lip of the chasm.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Now there was less spray in the\nair to dim Birinair's flame. With less dampness to blur it, the stone wall\nshowed more of its essential granite. Between the wall and the chasm, Covenant\nclung to the reassurance of the roadway. When he put a foot down hard, he could\nfeel the solidity of the ledge jolt from his heel t the base of his spine.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Around him, the cave had become\nlike a tunnel except for the chasm on the left. He fought his apprehension by\nconcentrating on his feet and the Hirebrand's flame. The river fell helplessly,\nand its roar faded like fingers scraping for a lost purchase. Soon he began to\nhear the moving noises of the company. He turned to try to see the opening of\nthe Gorge, but either the road had been curving gradually, or the opening had\nbeen lost in the distance; he saw nothing behind him but night as unmitigated\nas the blackness ahead.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>But after a time he felt that the\nlooming dark was losing its edge. Some change in the air attenuated the\nmidnight of the catacombs. He stared ahead, trying to clarify the perception.\nNo one spoke; the company</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>hugged its silence as if in fear\nthat the walls were capable of hearing.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Shortly, however, Birinair halted.\nCovenant, Lithe, and the Lords quickly joined the old Hirebrand. With him stood\nTerrel.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Warrenbridge lies\nahead,&quot; said the Bloodguard. &quot;Korik watches. There are\nsentries.&quot; He spoke softly, but after the long silence his voice sounded\ncareless of hazards.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Ah, I feared that,&quot;\nwhispered Prothall. &quot;Can we approach?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Rocklight makes dark\nshadows. The sentries stand atop the span. We can approach within\nbowshot.&quot; Mhoram called quietly for Quaan while Prothall asked, &quot;How\nmany sentries?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Terrel replied, &quot;Two.&quot;\n&quot;Only two?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The Bloodguard shrugged\nfractionally. &quot;They suffice. Between them lies the only entrance to the\nWightwarrens.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>But Prothall breathed again,\n&quot;Only two?&quot; He seemed to be groping to recognize a danger he could\nnot see.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>While the High Lord considered,\nMhoram spoke rapidly to Quaan. At once, the Warhaft turned to his Eoman, and\nshortly two warriors stood by Terrel, unslinging their bows. They were tall,\nslim Woodhelvennin, and in the pale light their limbs hardly looked brawny\nenough to bend their stiff bows.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>For a moment longer, Prothall\nhesitated, pulling at his beard as if he were trying to tug a vague impression\ninto consciousness. But then he thrust his anxiety down, gave Terrel a sharp\nnod. Briskly, the Bloodguard led the two warriors away toward the attenuated\nnight ahead.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Prothall whispered intently to the\ncompany, &quot;Have a care. Take no risk without my order. My heart tells me there\nis peril here-some strange danger which Kevin's Lore names-but now I cannot\nrecall it. Ah, memory! That knowledge is so dim and separate from what we have\nknown since the Desecration.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Think, all of you. Take great\ncare.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Walking slowly, he went forward\nbeside Birinair, and the company followed.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Now the light became steadily\nclearer-an orange-red, rocky glow like that which Covenant had seen long ago in\nhis brief meeting with Drool in Kiril Threndor. Soon the Questers could see\nthat in a few hundred yards the cave took a sharp turn to the right, and at the\nsame time the ceiling of the tunnel rose as if there were a great vault beyond\nthe bend.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Before they had covered half the\ndistance, Korik joined them to guide them to a safe vantage. On the way, he pointed\nout the position of Terrel and the two warriors. They had climbed partway up\nthe right wall, and were kneeling on a ledge in the angle of the bend.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Korik led the company close to the\nriver cleft until they reached a sheer stone wall. The chasm appeared to leave\nthem-vanish straight into the rock which turned the road toward the right-but\nlight shone over this rock as well as through the chasm. The rock was not a\nwall, but rather a huge boulder</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>sitting like a door ajar before\nthe entrance to an immense chamber. Terrel had taken the two warriors to a\nposition from which they could fire their shafts over this boulder.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Korik guided Prothall, Mhoram, and\nCovenant across the shadow cast by the boulder until they could peer to the\nleft around its edge. Covenant found himself looking into a high, flat-floored\ncavern. The chasm of the river swung around behind the boulder, and cut at\nright angles to its previous direction straight through the center of the\nvault, then disappeared into the far wall. So the roadway went no farther along\nthe river's course. But there were no other openings in the outer half of the\ncavern.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>At that point, the chasm was at\nleast fifty feet wide. The only way, across it was a massive bridge of native\nstone which filled the middle of the vault.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Carefully, Mhoram whispered,\n&quot;Only two. They are enough. Pray for a true aim. There will be no second\nchance.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>At first, Covenant saw no guards.\nHis eyes were held by two pillars of pulsing, fiery rocklight which stood like\nsentries on either side of the bridge crest. But he forced himself to study the\nbridge, and shortly he discerned two black figures on the span, one beside each\npillar. They were nearly invisible so close to the rocklight.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Ur-viles,&quot; the High\nLord muttered. &quot;By the Seven! I must remember! Why are they not\nCavewights? Why does Drool waste ur-viles on such duty?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant hardly listened to\nProthall's uneasiness. The rocklight demanded his attention; it seemed to hold\naffinities for him that he could not guess. By some perverse logic of its\npulsations, he felt himself made aware of his wedding band. The Droolish,\npowerful glow made his hand itch around his ring like a reminder that its\npromise of cherishing had failed. Grimly, he clenched his fist.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Prothall gripped himself, said\nheavily to Korik, &quot;Make the attempt. We can only fail.&quot; Without a\nword, Korik nodded up at Terrel.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Together, two bowstrings thrummed\nflatly.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The next instant, the ur-viles\nwere gone. Covenant caught a glimpse of them dropping like black pebbles into\nthe chasm.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The High Lord sighed his relief.\nMhoram turned away from the vault, threw a salute of congratulation toward the\ntwo archers, then hurried back to give explanations and orders to the rest of\nthe company. From the Eoman came low murmured cheers, and the noises of a\nrelaxation of battle tension.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Do not lower your\nguard!&quot; Prothall hissed. &quot;The danger is not past. I feel it.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant stood where he was;\nstaring into the rocklight, clenching his fist. Something that he did not\nunderstand was happening.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Ur-Lord,&quot; Prothall\nasked softly, &quot;what do you see?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Power.&quot; The\ninterruption irritated him. His voice scraped roughly in his throat.\n&quot;Drool's got enough to make you look silly.&quot; He raised his left fist.\n&quot;It's daylight outside.&quot; His ring burned blood-red, throbbed to the\npulse of the rocklight.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Prothall frowned at the ring,\nconcentrating fiercely. His lips were taut over his teeth as he muttered,\n&quot;This is not right. I must remember. Rocklight cannot do this.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Mhoram approached; and said before\nhe saw what was between Covenant and Prothall, &quot;Terrel has rejoined us. We\nare ready to cross.&quot; Prothall nodded inattentively. Then Mhoram noticed\nthe ring. Covenant heard a sound as if Mhoram were grinding his teeth. The Lord\nreached out, clasped his hand over Covenant's fist.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>A moment later, he turned and\nsignaled to the company. Quaan led his Eoman forward with the Bloodguard.\nProthall looked distracted, but he went with Birinair into the vault.\nAutomatically, Covenant followed them toward Warrenbridge.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Tuvor and another Bloodguard went\nahead of the High Lord. They neared the bridge, inspecting it to be sure that\nthe span was truly safe before the Lords crossed.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant wandered forward as if in\na trance. The spell of the rocklight grew on him. His ring began to feel hot. He\nhad to make an effort of consciousness to wonder why his ring was bloody rather\nthan orangered like the glowing pillars. But he had no answer. He felt a change\ncoming over him that he could not resist or measure or even analyze. It was as\nif his ring were confusing his senses, turning them on their pivots to peer\ninto unknown dimensions.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Tuvor and his comrade started up\nthe bridge. Prothall held the company back, despite the inherent danger of\nremaining in the open light. He stared after Tuvor and yanked at his beard with\na hand which trembled agedly.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant felt the spell mastering\nhim. The cavern began to change. In places, the rock walls seemed thinner, as\nif they were about to become transparent. Quaan and Lithe and the warriors grew\ntransparent as well, approached the evanescence of wraiths. Prothall and Mhoram\nappeared solider, but Prothall flickered where Mhoram was steady. Only the\nBloodguard showed no sign of dissipating, of losing their essence in mist-the\nBloodguard and the ring. Covenant's own flesh now looked so vague that he\nfeared his ring would fall through it to the stone. At his shoulder, Bannor\nstood-hard, implacable and dangerous, as if the Bloodguard's mere touch might\nscatter his beclouded being to the winds.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>He was drifting into transience.\nHe tried to clench himself; his fingers came back empty.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Tuvor neared the crest of the\nspan. The bridge seemed about to crumble under him-he appeared so much solider\nthan the stone.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Then Covenant saw it-a loop of\nshimmering air banded around the center of the bridge, standing fiat across the\nroadway and around under the span and back. He did not know what it was,\nunderstood nothing about it, except that it was powerful.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Tuvor was about to step into it.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>With an effort like a convulsion,\nCovenant started to fight, resist the spell. Some intuition told him that Tuvor\nwould be killed. Even a leper! he adjured himself. This was not his bargain; he\nhad not promised to stand silent and watch men die. Hellfire! Then, with\nrecovered rage, he cried again, Hellfire!</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Stop!&quot; he gasped.\n&quot;Can't you see?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>At once, Prothall shouted,\n&quot;Tuvor! Do not move!&quot; Wheeling on Covenant, he demanded, &quot;What\nis it? What do you see?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The violence of his rage brought\nback some of the solidity to his vision. But Prothall still appeared\ndangerously evanescent. Covenant jerked up his ring, spat, &quot;Get them down.\nAre you blind? It's not the rocklight. Something else up there.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Mhoram recalled Tuvor and his\ncompanion. But for a moment Prothall only stared in blank fear at Covenant.\nThen, abruptly, he struck his staff on the stone and ejaculated,\n&quot;Ur-viles! And rocklight just there as anchors! Ah, I am blind, blind!\nThey tend the power!&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Incredulously, Mhoram whispered,\n&quot;A Word of Warning?&quot; &quot;Yes!&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Is it possible? Has Drool\nentirely mastered the Staff? Can he speak such might?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Prothall was already on his way\ntoward the bridge. Over his shoulder, he replied, &quot;He has Lord Foul to\nteach him. We have no such help.&quot; A moment later, he strode up the span\nwith Tuvor close behind him.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The spell reached for Covenant\nagain. But he knew it better now, and held it at bay with curses. He could\nstill see the shimmering loop of the Word as Prothall neared it.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The High Lord approached slowly,\nand at last halted a step before the Word. Gripping his staff in his left hand,\nhe held his right arm up with the palm forward like a gesture of recognition.\nWith a rattling cough, he began to sing. Constantly repeating the same motif,\nhe sang cryptically in a language Covenant did not understand-a language so old\nthat it sounded grizzled and hoary. Prothall sang it softly, intimately, as if\nhe were entering into private communion with the Word of Warning.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Gradually, vaguely, like imminent\nmist, the Word became visible to the company. In the air opposite Prothall's\npalm, an indistinct shred of red appeared, coalesced, like a fragment of an\nunseen tapestry. The pale, hanging red expanded until a large, rough circle was\ncentered opposite his palm. With extreme caution -singing all the while-he\nraised his hand to measure the height of the Word, moved sideways to judge its\nconfiguration. Thus in tatters the company saw the barrier which opposed them.\nAnd as Covenant brought more of himself to the pitch of his stiff rage, his own\nperception of the Word paled until he saw only as much of it as the others did.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>At last, Prothall lowered his hand\nand ceased his song. The shreds vanished. He came tightly down the bridge as if\nhe were only holding himself erect by the simple strength of his resolution.\nBut his gaze was full of comprehension and the measure of risks.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;A Word of Warning,&quot; he\nreported sternly, &quot;set here by the power of the Staff of Law to inform\nDrool if his defenses were breached-and to break Warrenbridge at the first\ntouch.&quot; His tone carried a glimpse of a plunge into the chasm. &quot;It is\na work of great power. No Lord since the Desecration has been capable of such a\nfeat. And even if we had the might to undo it, we would gain nothing, for Drool\nwould be warned. Still, there is one sign in our favor. Such a Word cannot be\nmaintained without constant attention. It must be tended, else it decays-though\nnot speedily enough for our purpose. That Drool set urviles here as sentries\nperhaps shows that his mind is elsewhere.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Wonderful! Covenant growled\ncorrosively. Terrific! His hands itched with an intense urge to throttle\nsomeone.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Prothall continued: .&quot;If\nDrool's eyes are turned away, it may be that we can bend the Word without\nbreaking.&quot; He took a deep breath, then asserted, &quot;I believe it can be\ndone. This Word is not as pure and dangerous as might be.&quot; He turned to\nCovenant. &quot;But I fear for you, ur-Lord.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;For me?&quot; Covenant\nreacted as if the High Lord had accused him of something. &quot;Why?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;I fear that the mere\ncloseness of your ring to the Word may undo it. So you must come last. And even\nthen we may be caught within the catacombs, with no bridge to bear us out\nagain.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Last? He had a sudden vision of\nbeing forsaken or trapped here, blocked by that deep cleft from the escape he\nneeded. He wanted to protest, Let me go first. If I can make it, anybody can.\nBut he saw the folly of that argument. Forbear, he urged himself. Keep the\nbargain. His fear made him sound bitter as he grated, &quot;Get on with it.\nThey're bound to send some new guards one of these days.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Prothall nodded. With a last measuring\nlook at Covenant, he turned away. He and Mhoram went up onto the bridge to\nengage the Word.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Tuvor and Terrel followed carrying\ncoils of clingor which they attached to the Lords' waists and anchored at the\nfoot of the bridge. Thus secured against the collapse of the span, Prothall and\nMhoram ascended cautiously until they were only an arm's length from the\ninvisible Word. There they knelt together and started their song.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>When the bottom of the Word became\nvisible in crimson, they placed their staffs parallel to it on the stone before\nthem. Then, with tortuous care, they rolled their staffs directly under the\niridescent power For one bated moment, they remained still in an attitude of\nprayer as if beseeching their wood not to interrupt the current flowing past\ntheir faces. A heartstopping flicker replied in the red shimmer. But the Lords\nwent on singing-and shortly the Word steadied.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Bracing themselves, they started\nthe most difficult part of their task. They began lifting the inner ends of\ntheir staffs.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>With a quick intake of wonder and\nadmiration, the company saw the lower edge of the Word bend, leaving a low,\ntented gap below it.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>When the peak of the gap was more\nthan a foot high, the Lords froze. Instantly, Bannor and two other Bloodguard\ndashed up the bridge, unrolling a rope as they ran. One by one, they crawled\nthrough the gap and took their end of the lifeline to safe ground beyond the\nspan.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>As soon as Bannor had attached his\nend of the rope, Mhoram took hold of Prothall's staff. The High Lord wormed\nthrough the gap, then held the staffs for Mhoram. By the time Mhoram had\nregained his position beside Prothall, old Birinair was there and ready to\npass. Behind him in rapid single file went the Eoman, followed by Quaan and\nLithe.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>In turn, Tuvor and Terrel slipped\nunder the Word and anchored their ropes to the two Lords beyond the chasm.\nThen, moving at a run, the last Bloodguard slapped the central lifeline around\nCovenant and made their way through the gap.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>He was left alone.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>In a cold sweat of anger and fear,\nhe started up the bridge. He felt the two pillars of rocklight as if they</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>were scrutinizing him. He went up\nthe span fiercely, cursing Foul, and cursing himself for his fear. He did not\ngive a glance to the chasm. Staring at the gap, he ground his rage into focus,\nand approached the shimmering tapestry of power. As he drew nearer, his ring\nached on his hand. The bridge seemed to grow thinner as if it were dissolving\nunder him. The Word became starker, dominating his vision more and more.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>But he kept his hold on his rage.\nEven a leper! He reached the gap, knelt before it, looked momentarily through\nthe shimmer at the Lords. Their faces ran with sweat, and their voices trembled\nin their song. He clenched his hands around the staff of Baradakas, and crawled\ninto the gap.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>As he passed under the Word, he\nheard an instant high keening like a whine of resistance. For that instant, a\ncold red flame burst from his ring.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Then he was through, and the\nbridge and the Word were still intact.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>He stumbled down the span,\nflinging off the clingor lifeline. When he was safe, he turned long enough to\nsee Prothall and Mhoram remove their staffs from under the Word. Then he\nstalked out of the vault of Warrenbridge into the dark tunnel of the roadway.\nHe felt Bannor's presence at his shoulder almost at once, but he did not stop\nuntil the darkness against which he thrust himself was thick enough to seem\nimpenetrable.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>In frustration and congested fear,\nhe groaned, &quot;I want to be alone. Why don't you leave me alone?&quot; With\nthe repressed lilt of his Haruchai inflection, Bannor responded, &quot;You are\nur-Lord Covenant. We are the Bloodguard. Your life is in our care.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant glared into the\nineluctable dark around him, and thought about the unnatural solidity of the\nBloodguard. What binding principle made their flesh seem less mortal than the\ngutrock of Mount Thunder? A glance at his ring showed him that its incarnadine\ngleam had almost entirely faded. He found that he was jealous of Bannor's\ndispassion; his own pervasive irrectitude offended him. On the impulse of a\nferocious intuition, he returned, &quot;That isn't enough.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>He could envision Bannor's slight,\neloquent shrug without seeing it. In darkness he waited defiantly until the\ncompany caught up with him.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>But when he was again marching in\nhis place in the Quest-when Birinair's wan flame had passed by him, treading as\nif transfixed by leadership the invisible directions of the roadway-the night\nof the catacombs crowded toward him like myriad leering spectators, impatient\nfor bloodshed, and he suffered a reaction against the strain. His shoulders\nbegan to tremble, as if he had been hanging by his arms too long, and cold\npetrifaction settled over his thoughts.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The Word of Warning revealed that\nLord Foul was expecting them, knew they would not fall victim to Drool's army.\nDrool could not have formed the Word, much less made it so apposite to white\ngold. Therefore it served the Despiser's purposes rather than Drool's. Perhaps\nit was a test of some kind-a measure of the Lords' strength and resourcefulness,\nan indication of Covenant's vulnerability. But whatever it was, it was Lord\nFoul's doing. Covenant felt sure that the Despiser knew everything-planned,\narranged, made inevitable all that happened to the Quest, every act and\ndecision. Drool was ignorant, mad, manipulated; the Cavewight probably failed\nto understand half of what he achieved under Lord Foul's hand.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>But in his bones Covenant had\nknown such things from the beginning. They did not surprise him; rather,</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>he saw them as symptoms of another,\na more essential threat. This central peril-a peril which so froze his mind\nthat only his flesh seemed able to react by trembling-had to do with his white\ngold ring. He perceived the danger clearly because he was too numb to hide from\nit. The whole function of the compromise, the bargain, he had made with the\nRanyhyn, was to hold the impossibility and the actuality of the Land apart, in\nequipoise-Back off! Let me be!-to keep them from impacting into each other and\nblasting his precarious hold on life. But Lord Foul was using his ring to bring\ncrushing together the opposite madnesses which he needed so desperately to\nescape.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>He considered throwing the ring\naway. But he knew he could not do it. The band was too heavy with remembered\nlost love and honor and mutual respect to be tossed aside. And an old beggar If\nhis bargain failed, he would have nothing left with which to defend himself\nagainst the darkness-no power or fertility or coherence-nothing but his own\ncapacity for darkness, his violence, his ability to kill. That capacity led-he\nwas too numb to resist the conclusion-as inalterably as leprosy to the\ndestruction of the Land.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>There his numbness seemed to\nbecome complete. He could not measure his situation more than that. All he\ncould do was trail behind Birinair's flame and tell over his refusals like some\ndespairing acolyte, desperate for faith, trying to invoke his own autonomy.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>He concentrated on his footing as\nif it were tenuous and the rock unsure-as if Birinair might lead him over the\nedge of an abyss.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Gradually the character of their\nbenighted journey changed. First, the impression of the surrounding tunnel\naltered. Behind the darkness, the walls seemed to open from time to time into\nother tunnels, and at one point the night took on an enormous depth, as if the\ncompany were passing over the floor of an amphitheater. In this blind openness,\nBirinair searched for his way. When the sense of vast empty space vanished, he\nled his companions into a stone corridor so low that his flame nearly touched the\nceiling, so narrow that they had to pass in single file.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Then the old Hearthrall took them\nthrough a bewildering series of shifts in direction and terrain and depth. From\nthe low tunnel, they turned sharply and went down a long, steep slope with no\ndiscernible walls. As they descended, turning left and right at landmarks only\nBirinair seemed able to see, the black air became colder and somehow loathsome,\nas if it carried an echo of ur-viles. The cold came in sudden drafts and\npockets, blowing through chasms and tunnels that opened unseen on either side\ninto dens and coverts and passages and great Cavewightish halls, all invisible\nbut for the timbre, the abrupt impression of space, which they gave the\ndarkness.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Lower down the sudden drafts began\nto stink. The buried air seemed to flow over centuries of accumulated filth,\nvast hordes of unencrypted dead, long abandoned laboratories where banes were\nmade. At moments, the putrescence became so thick that Covenant could see it in\nthe sir. And out of the adjacent openings came cold, distant sounds the rattle\nof shale dropping into immeasurable faults;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>occasional low complaints of\nstress; soft, crystalline, chinking noises like the tap of iron hammers;\nmuffled sepulchral detonations; and long tired sighs, exhalations of fatigue\nfrom the ancient foundations of the mountain. The darkness itself seemed to be\nmuttering as the company passed.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>But at the end of the descent they\nreached a wavering stair cut into a rock wall, with lightless, hungry chasms\ngaping below them. And after that, they went through winding tunnels, along the\nbottoms of crevices, over sharp rock ridges like aretes within the mountain,\naround pits with the moan of water and the reek of decay in their depths, under\narches like entryways to grotesque festal halls-turned and climbed and\nnavigated in the darkness as if it were a perilous limbo, trackless and fatal,\nvarying only in</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>the kind and extremity of its\ndangers. Needing proof of his own reality, Covenant moved with the fingers of\nhis left hand knotted in his robe over his heart.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Three times in broad, fiat spaces\nwhich might have been halls or ledges or peak tops surrounded by plunges, the\ncompany stopped and ate cold food by the light of Birinair's staff. Each meal\nhelped; the sight of other faces around the flame, the consumption of tangible\nprovender, acted like an affirmation or a pooling of the company's capacity for\nendurance. Once, Quaan forced himself to attempt a jest, but his voice sounded\nso hollow in the perpetual midnight that no one had the heart to reply. After\neach rest, the Questers set out again bravely. And each time, their pooled\nfortitude evaporated more rapidly, as if the darkness inhaled it with\nincreasing voracity.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Later old Birinair led them out of\ncold and ventilated ways into close, musty, hot tunnels far from the main\nWightwarrens. To reduce the risk of discovery, he chose a path through a\nsection of the caves deader than the restsilent and abandoned, with little\nfresh air left. But the atmosphere only raised the pitch of the company's\ntension. They moved as if they were screaming voicelessly in anticipation of\nsome blind disaster.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>They went on and on, until\nCovenant knew only that they had not marched for days because his ring had not\nyet started to glow with the rising of the moon. But after a time his white\ngold began to gleam lik a crimson prophecy. Still they went on into what he now\nknew was night. They could not afford sleep or long rests. The peak of Drool's\npresent power was only one day away.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>They were following a tunnel with\nwalls which seemed to stand just beyond the reach of Birinair's tottering fire.\nAbruptly, Terrel returned from his scouting position, loomed out of the\ndarkness to appear before the old Hirebrand. Swiftly, Prothall and Mhoram, with\nLithe and Covenant behind them, hastened to Birinair's side. Terrel's voice\nheld a note like urgency as he said, &quot;Ur-viles approach-perhaps fifty.\nThey have seen the light.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Prothall groaned; Mhoram spat a\ncurse. Manethrall Lithe drew a hissing breath, whipped her cord from her hair\nas if she were about to encounter the stuff of which Ramen nightmares were\nmade.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>But before anyone could take\naction, old Birinair seemed to snap like a dry twig. Shouting,\n&quot;Follow!&quot; he spun to his right and raced away into the darkness.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>At once, two Bloodguard sprinted\nafter him. For an instant, the Lords hesitated. Then Prothall cried,\n&quot;Melenkurion!&quot; and dashed after Birinair. Mhoram began shouting\norders; the company sprang into battle readiness.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant fled after Birinair's\nbobbing fire. The Hirebrand's shout had not sounded like panic. That\ncry-Follow!-urged Covenant along. Behind him, he heard the first commands and\nclatters of combat. He kept his eyes on Birinair's light, followed him into a\nlow, nearly airless tunnel.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Birinair raced down the tunnel,\nstill a stride or two ahead of the Bloodguard.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Suddenly, there came a hot noise\nlike a burst of lightning; without warning a sheet of blue flame enveloped the\nHirebrand. Dazzling, coruscating, it walled the tunnel from top to bottom. It\nroared like a furnace. And Birinair hung in it, spread-limbed and transfixed,\nhis frame contorted with agony. Beside him, his staff flared and became ash.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Without hesitation, the two\nBloodguard threw themselves at the fire. It knocked them back like blank stone.\nThey leaped together at Birinair, trying to force him through and past the\nflame sheet. But they had</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>no effect; Birinair hung where he\nwas, a charred victim in a web of blue fire.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The Bloodguard were poised to\nspring again when the High Lord caught up with them. He had to shout to make\nhimself heard over the crackling of power. &quot;My place!&quot; he cried,\nalmost screaming. &quot;He will die! Aid Mhoram!&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>He seemed to have fallen over an\nedge into distraction. His eyes had a look of chaos. Spreading his arms, he went\nforward and tried to embrace Birinair.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The fire kicked him savagely away.\nHe fell, and for a long moment lay facedown on the stone. Behind them, the\nbattle mounted. The ur-viles had formed a wedge, and even with all the help of\nthe Bloodguard and warriors, Mhoram barely held his ground. The first rush of\nthe attack had driven the company back; Mhoram had retreated several yards into\nthe tunnel where Birinair hung. There he made a stand. Despite Prothall's cries\nand the roar of the fire behind him, he kept his face toward the ur-viles.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Heavily, Prothall raised himself.\nHis head trembled on his tired old neck. But his eyes were no longer wild.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>He took a moment to recollect\nhimself, knowing that he was already too late. Then, mustering his strength, he\nhurled his staff at the blue coruscation.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The shod wood struck with a\nblinding flash. For one blank instant, Covenant could see nothing. When his\nvision cleared, he found the staff hanging in the sheet of flame. Birinair lay\nin the tunnel beyond the fire.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Birinair!&quot; the High\nLord cried. &quot;My friend! &quot;He seemed to believe that he could help the\nHirebrand if he reached him in time. Once again, he flung himself at the flame,\nand was flung back.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The ur-viles pressed their attack\nferociously, in hungry silence. Two of Quaan's Eoman were felled as the company\nbacked into the tunnel, and one more died now with an iron spike in his heart.\nA woman struck in too close to the wedge, and her hand was hacked off. Mhoram\nfought the loremaster with growing desperation. Around him, the Bloodguard\nbattled skillfully, but they could find few openings in the wedge.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant peered through the blue\nsheet at Birinair. The Hirebrand's face was unmarked, but it held a wide stare\nof agony, as if he had remained alive for one instant after his soul had been\nseared. The remains of his cloak hung about him in charred wisps.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Follow!</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>That call had not been panic.\nBirinair had had some idea. His shout echoed and compelled. His cloak hung\nabout him Follow!</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant had forgotten\nsomething-something important. Wildly, he started forward.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Mhoram strove to strike harder.\nHis strength played like lightning along his staff as he dealt blow after blow\nagainst the loremaster. Weakened by its losses, the wedge began to give ground.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant stopped, inches away from\nthe sheet of power. Prothall's staff was suspended vertically</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>within it like a landmark. The\nfire seemed to absorb rather than give off heat. Covenant felt himself growing\ncold and numb. In the dazzling blue force, he saw a chance for immolation,\nescape.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Abruptly, the ur-vile loremaster\ngave a barking shout, and broke formation. It ducked past Mhoram and dashed\ninto the tunnel toward the fire, toward the kneeling High Lord. Mhoram's eyes\nflashed perilously, but he did not turn from the fight. He snapped an order to\nQuaan, and struck at the ur-viles with still fiercer force.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Quaan leaped from the fight. He\nraced to unsling his bow, nock an arrow, and shoot before the loremaster\nreached Prothall.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Vaguely, Covenant heard the High\nLord gasp against the dead air, &quot;Ur-Lord! Beware!&quot; But he did not\nlisten. His wedding band burned as if the defiled moon were like the rocklight\non Warrenbridge-a Word of Warning.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>He reached out his left hand,\nhesitated momentarily, then grasped the High Lord's staff.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Power surged. Bloody fire burst\nfrom his ring against the coruscating blue. The roar of the flame cycled upward\nbeyond hearing. Then came a mighty blast, a silent explosion. The floor of the\ntunnel jumped as if its keel had struck a reef.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The blue sheet fell in tatters.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Quaan was too late to save\nProthall. But the ur-vile did not attack the High Lord. It sprang over him\ntoward Covenant. With all his strength, Quaan bent his bow and fired at the\ncreature's back.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>For an instant, Covenant stood\nstill, listing crazily to one side and staring in horror at the abrupt\ndarkness. Dim orange fire burned on his hand and arm, but the brilliant blue\nwas gone. The fire gave no pain, though at first it clung to him as if he were\ndry wood. It was cold and empty, and it died out in sputtering flickers, as if\nafter all he did not contain enough warmth to feed it.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Then the loremaster, with Quaan's\narrow squarely between its shoulders, crashed into him and scattered him across\nthe stone.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>A short time later, he looked up\nwith his head full of mist. The only light in the tunnel came from Mhoram's\nLords-fire as he drove back the ur-viles. Then that light was gone, too; the\nur-viles were routed. Tuvor and the Bloodguard, started after them to prevent\nthem from carrying reports to Drool, but Mhoram called, &quot;Let them go! We\nare already exposed. No reports - of ur-viles matter now.&quot; Voices gasped\nand groaned in the darkness; soon two or three of the warriors lit torches. The\nflames cast odd, dim shadows on the walls. The company drew together around\nLord Mhoram and moved down to where Prothall knelt.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The High Lord held Birinair's\ncharred form in his arms. But he brushed aside the sympathy and grief of the\ncompany. &quot;Go on,&quot; he said weakly. &quot;Discover what he intended. I\nwill be done with my farewells soon.&quot; In explanation, he added, &quot;He\nled in my place.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Mhoram laid a commiserating hand\non the High Lord's shoulder. But the dangers of their situation did not allow\nhim to remain still. Almost certainly, Drool now knew where they were; the\nenergies they had released would point them out like an accusing finger.\n&quot;Why?&quot; Mhoram wondered aloud. &quot;Why was such power placed here?\nThis is not Drool's doing.&quot; Carrying one of the torches, he started down\nthe tunnel.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>From his collapse on the stone,\nCovenant replied in a grotesque, stricken voice. But he was answering a\ndifferent question. &quot;I forgot my clothes-left them behind.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Mhoram bent over him. Lighting his\nface with the torch, the Lord asked, &quot;Are you injured? I do not\nunderstand. Of what importance are your old clothes?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The question seemed to require a\nworld of explanation, but Covenant responded easily, glib with numbness and\nfog. &quot;Of course I'm injured. My whole life is an injury.&quot; He hardly\nlistened to his own speech. &quot;Don't you see? When I wake up, and find\nmyself dressed in my old clothes, not this moss-stained robe at all-why, that\nwill prove that I really have been dreaming. If it wasn't so reassuring, I\nwould be terrified.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;You have mastered a great\npower,&quot; Mhoram murmured.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;That was an accident. It\nhappened by itself. I was -I was trying to escape. Burn myself.&quot; Then the\nstrain overcame him. He lowered his head to the stone and went to sleep.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>He did not rest long; the air of\nthe tunnel was too uncomfortable, and there was too much activity in the company.\nWhen he opened his eyes, he saw Lithe and several warriors preparing a meal\nover a low fire. With a trembling song on his lips, and tears spilling from his\neyes, Prothall was using his blue fire to sear the injured woman's wrist-stump.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant watched as she bore the\npain; only when her wrist was tightly bandaged did she let herself faint. After\nthat he turned away, sick with shared pain. He lurched to his feet, reeled as\nif he could not find his footing, had to brace himself against the wall. He stood\nthere hunched over his aching stomach until Mhoram returned, accompanied by\nQuaan, Korik, and two other Bloodguard.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The Warhaft was carrying a small\niron chest.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>When Mhoram reached the fire, he\nspoke in quiet wonder. &quot;The power was a defense placed here by High Lord\nKevin. Beyond this tunnel lies a chamber. There we found the Second Ward of\nKevin's Lore the Second of the Seven.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>High Lord Prothall's face lit up\nwith hope.<br clear=all style='page-break-before:always'>\n</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><a name=\"_Toc370739028\"><span class=Heading1Char><span\nstyle='font-size:16.0pt;line-height:105%'>TWENTY-THREE: Kiril Threndor</span></span></a></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Reverently, Prothall took the\nchest. His fingers fumbled at the bindings. When he raised the lid, a pale,\npearly glow like clean moonlight shone from within the cask. The radiance gave\nhis face a look of beatitude as he ventured his hand into the chest to lift out\nan ancient scroll. When he raised it, the company saw that it was the scroll\nwhich shone.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Quaan and his Eoman half knelt\nbefore the Ward, bowed their heads. Mhoram and Prothall stood erect as if they\nwere meeting the scrutiny of the master of their lives. After a moment of\namazement, Lithe</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>joined the warriors. Only Covenant\nand the Bloodguard showed no reverence. Tuvor's comrades stood casually alert,\nand Covenant leaned uncomfortably against the wall, trying to bring his unruly\nstomach under control.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>But he was not blind to the\nimportance of that scroll. A private hope wrestled with his nausea. He\napproached it obliquely. &quot;Did Birinair know-what you were going to find?\nIs that why?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Why he ran here?&quot;\nMhoram spoke absently; all of him except his voice was focused on the scroll\nwhich Prothall held up like a mighty talisman. &quot;Perhaps it is possible. He\nknew the old maps. No doubt they were given to us in the First Ward so that in\ntime we might find our way here. It may be that his heart saw what our eyes did\nnot.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant paused, then asked,\nobliquely again, &quot;Why did you let the ur-viles escape?&quot; This time,\nthe Lords seemed to hear his seriousness.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>With a piercing glance at him,\nProthall replaced the scroll in the cask. When the lid was closed, Mhoram\nanswered stiffly, &quot;Unnecessary death, Unbeliever. We did not come here to\nslay ur-viles. We will harm ourselves more by unnecessary killing than by\nrisking a few live foes. We fight in need, not in lust or rage. The Oath of\nPeace must not be compromised.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>But this also did not answer\nCovenant's question. With an effort, he brought out his hope directly.\n&quot;Never mind. This Second Ward-it doubles your power. You could send me\nback.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Mhoram's face softened at the need\nfor assurance, for consolation against impossible demands, in the question. But\nhis reply denied Covenant. &quot;Ah, my friend, you forget. We have not yet\nmastered the First Ward-not in generations of study. The best of the Loresraat\nhave failed to unveil the central mysteries. We can do nothing with this new\nWard now. Perhaps, if we survive this Quest, we will learn from the Second in\nlater years.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>There he stopped. His face held a\n/look of further speech, but he said no more until Prothall sighed, &quot;Tell\nhim all. We can afford no illusions now.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Very well.&quot; Mhoram said\nhurriedly, &quot;In truth, our possession of the Second Ward at such a time is\nperilous. It is clear from the First that High Lord Kevin prepared the Seven in\ncareful order. It was his purpose that the Second Ward remain hidden until all\nthe First was known. Apparently, certain aspects of his Lore carry great hazard\nto those who have not first mastered certain other aspects. So he hid his\nWards, and defended them with powers which could not be breached until the\nearlier Lore was mastered. Now his intent has been broken. Until we penetrate the\nFirst, we will risk much if we attempt the use of the Second.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>He pulled himself up and took a\ndeep breath. &quot;We do not regret. For all our peril, this discovery may be\nthe great moment of our age. But it may not altogether bless us.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>In a low voice, Prothall added,\n&quot;We raise no blame or doubt. How could any have known what we would find?\nBut the doom of the Land is now doubly on our heads. If we are to defeat Lord\nFoul in the end, we must master powers for which we are not ready. So we learn\nhope and dismay from the same source. Do not mistake us-this risk we accept\ngladly. The mastery of Kevin's Lore is the goal of our lives. But we must make\nclear that there is risk. I see hope for the Land, but little for myself.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Even that sight is\ndim,&quot; said Mhoram tightly. &quot;It may be that Lord Foul has led us here\nso that we may</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>be betrayed by powers we cannot\ncontrol.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>At this, Prothall looked sharply\nat Mhoram. Then, slowly, the High Lord nodded his agreement. But his face did\nnot lose the relief, the lightening of its burdens, which his first sight of\nthe Ward had given him. Under its influence, he looked equal to the stewardship\nof his age. Now the time of High Lord Prothall son of Dwillian would be well\nremembered-if the company survived its Quest. His resolve had a forward look as\nhe closed the chest of the Second Ward; his movements were crisp and decisive.\nHe gave the cask to Korik, who bound it to his bare back with strips of\nclingor, and covered it by knotting his tunic shut.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>But Covenant looked at the remains\nof the brief structure of his own hope, collapsed like a child's toy house, and\nhe did not know where to turn for new edifices. He felt vaguely that he had no\nsolid ground on which to build them. He was too weak and tired to think about\nit. He stood leaning where he was for a long time, with his head bent as if he\nwere trying to decipher the chart of his robe.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Despite the danger, the company\nrested and ate there in the tunnel. Prothall judged that remaining where they\nwere for a time was as unpredictable as anything else they might do; so while\nthe Bloodguard stood watch, he encouraged his companions to rest. Then he lay\ndown, pillowed his head on his arms, and seemed at once to fall into deep\nsleep, so intensely calm and quiet that it looked more like preparation than\nrepose. Following his example, most of the company let their eyes close, though\nthey slept only fitfully. But Mhoram and Lithe remained watchful. He stared\ninto the low fire as if he were searching for a vision, and she sat across from\nhim with her shoulders hunched against the oppressive weight of the mountain\n-as unable to rest underground as if the lack of open sky and grasslands\noffended her Ramen blood. Reclining against the wall, Covenant regarded the two\nof them, and slept a little until the stain of his ring began to fade with\nmoonset.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>After that Prothall arose, awake\nand alert, and roused the company. As soon as everyone had eaten again, he put\nout the campfire. In its place, he lit one of the lillianrill torches. It\nguttered and jumped dangerously in the thick air, but he used it rather than\nhis staff to light the tunnel. Soon the Quest was marching again. Helpless to\ndo otherwise, they left their dead lying on the stone of the Ward chamber. It\nwas the only tribute they could give Birinair and the slain waArrgioairns. they\nwent into darkness, led by the High Lord through interminable, black,\nlabyrinthian passages in the deep rock of Mount Thunder. The air became\nthicker, hotter, deader. In spite of occasional ascents, their main progress\nwas downward, toward the bottomless roots of the mountain, closer with every\nunseen, unmeasured league toward immense, buried, slumbering, grim ills, the\nterrible bones of the Earth. On and on they walked as if they were amazed by\ndarkness, irremediable night. They made their way in hard silence, as if their\nlips were stiff with resisted sobs. They could not see. It affected them like a\nbereavement.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>As they approached the working\nheart of the Wightwarrens, certain sounds became louder, more distinct -the battering\nof anvils, the groaning of furnaces, gasps of anguish. From time to time they\ncrossed blasts of hot fetid air like forced ventilation for charnel pits. And a\nnew noise crept into their awareness-a sound of bottomless boiling. For a long\nwhile, they drew nearer to this deep moil without gaining any hint of what it\nwas.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Later they passed its source.\nTheir path lay along the lip of a huge cavern. The walls were lit luridly by a\nseething orange sea of rocklight. Far below them was a lake of molten stone.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>After the long darkness of their\ntrek, the bright light hurt their eyes. The rising acrid heat of the lake\nsnatched at them as if it were trying to pluck them from their perch. The deep,\nboiling sound thrummed in the air. Great gouts of magma spouted toward the\nceiling, then fell back into the lake like crumbling towers.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Vaguely, Covenant heard someone\nsay, &quot;The Demondim in the days of High Lord Loric discarded their failed\nbreeding efforts here. It is said that the loathing of the Demondim-and of the\nViles who sired them-for their own forms surpassed all restraint. It led them\nto the spawning which made both ur-viles and Waynhim. And it drove them to cast\nall their weak and faulty into such pits as this-so strongly did they abhor\ntheir unseen eyelessness.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Groaning, he turned his face to\nthe wall, and crept past the cavern into the passage beyond it. When he dropped\nhis hands from the support of the stone, his fingers twitched at his sides as\nif he were testing the sides of a casket.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Prothall chose to rest there, just\nbeyond the cavern of rocklight. The company ate a quick, cold meal, then\npressed on again into darkness. From this passage, they took two turns, went up\na long slope, and at length found themselves walking a ledge in a fault. Its\ncrevice fell away to their left. Covenant made his way absently, shaking his\nhead in an effort to clear his thoughts. Ur-viles reeled across his brain like\nimages of self-hatred, premonitions. Was he doomed to see himself even in such\ncreatures as that? No.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>He gritted his teeth. No. In the\nlight of remembered bursts of lava, he began to fear that he had already missed\nhis chance-his chance to fall In time, fatigue came back over him. Prothall\ncalled a rest halt on the ledge, and Covenant surprised himself nearly falling\nasleep that close to a crevice. But the High Lord was pushing toward his goal\nnow, and did not let the company rest long. With his guttering torch, he led\nthe Quest forward again, through darkness into darkness.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>As the trek dragged on, their\nmoment-by-moment caution began to slip. The full of the moon was coming, and\nsomewhere ahead Drool was preparing for them. Prothall moved as if he were\neager for the last test, and led them along the ledge at a stiff pace. As a\nresult, the lone ur-vile took them all by surprise.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>It had hidden itself in a thin\nfissure in the wall of the crevice. When Covenant passed it, it sprang out at\nhim, threw its weight against his chest. Its roynish, eyeless face was blank\nwith ferocity. As it struck him,</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>it grappled for his left hand.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The force of the attack knocked\nhim backward toward the crevice. For one flicker of time, he was not aware of\nthat danger. The ur-vile consumed his attention. It pulled his hand close to\nits face, sniffed wetly over his fingers as if searching for something, then\ntried to jam his ring finger into its ragged mouth.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>He staggered back one more step;\nhis foot left the ledge. In that instant, he realized the hungry fall under\nhim. Instinctively, he closed his fist against the ur-vile and ignored it.\nClinging to his staff with all the strength of his halfhand, he thrust its end\ntoward Bannor. The Bloodguard was already reaching for him.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Bannor caught hold of the staff.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>For one slivered moment, Covenant\nkept his grip.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>But the full weight of the ur-vile\nhung on his left arm. His hold tore loose from the staff. With the creature\nstruggling to bite off his ring, he plunged into the crevice.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Before he could shriek his terror,\na force like a boulder struck him, knocked the air from his lungs, left him\ngasping sickly as he plummeted. With his chest constricted and retching, unable\nto cry out, he lost consciousness.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>When he roused himself after the\nimpact, he was struggling for air against a faceful of dirt. He lay head down\non a steep slope of shale and loam and refuse, and the slide caused by his\nlanding had covered his face. For a long moment, he could not move except to\ngag and cough. His efforts shook him without freeing him.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Then, with a shuddering exertion,\nhe rolled over, thrust up his head. He coughed up a gout of dirt, and found\nthat he could breathe. But he still could not see. The fact took a moment to\npenetrate his awareness. He checked his face, found that his eyes were\nuncovered and open. But they perceived nothing except an utter and desolate\ndarkness. It was as if he were blind with panic-as if his optic nerves were\nnumb with terror.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>For a time he did panic. Without\nsight, he felt the empty air suck at him as if he were drowning in quicksand.\nThe night beat about him on naked wings like vultures dropping toward dead\nmeat.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>His heart beat out heavy jolts of\nfear. He cowered there on his knees, abandoned, bereft of eyes and light and\nmind by the extremity of his dread, and his breath whimpered in his throat. But\nas the first rush of his panic passed, he recognized it. Fear-it was an emotion\nhe understood, a part of the condition of his existence. And his heart went on\nbeating. Lurching as if wounded, it still kept up his life.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Suddenly, convulsively, he raised\nhis fists and struck at the shale on either side of his head, pounded to the\nrhythm of his pulse as if he were trying to beat rationality out of the dirt.\nNo! No! I am going to survive!</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The assertion steadied him.\nSurvive! He was a leper, accustomed to fear. He knew how to deal with it.\nDiscipline discipline.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>He pressed his hands over his\neyeballs; spots of color jerked across the black. He was not blind. He was\nseeing darkness. He had fallen away from the only light in the catacombs; of\ncourse he could not see.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Hell and blood.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Instinctively, he rubbed his\nhands, winced at the bruises he had given himself. Discipline.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>He was alone-alone- Lightless\nsomewhere on the bottom of a ledge of the crevice long leagues from the nearest\nopen sky. Without help, friends, rescue, for him the outside of the mountain\nwas as unattainable as if it had ceased to exist. Escape itself was\nunattainable unless Discipline.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>-unless he found some way to die.\nHellfire!</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Thirst. Hunger. Injury-loss of\nblood. He iterated the possibilities as if he were going through a VSE. He\nmight fall prey to some dark-bred bane. Might stumble over a more fatal\nprecipice. Madness, yes. It would be as easy as leprosy.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Midnight wings beat about his\nears, reeled vertiginously across the blind blackscape. His hands groped\nunconsciously around his head, seeking some way to defend himself.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Damnation!</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>None of this is happening to me.\nDiscipline!</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>A fetal fancy came over him. He\ncaught hold of it as if it were a vision. Yes! Quickly, he changed his position\nso that he was sitting on the shale slope. He fumbled over his belt until he\nfound Atiaran's knife. Poising it carefully in his halffingerless grip, he\nbegan to shave.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Without water or a mirror, he was\nperilously close to slitting his throat, and the dryness of his beard caused\nhim pain as if he were using the knife to dredge his face into a new shape. But\nthis risk, this pain, was part of him; there was nothing impossible about, it.\nIf he cut himself, the dirt on his skin would make infection almost\ninstantaneous. It calmed him like a demonstration of his identity.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>In that way, he made the darkness\ndraw back, withhold its talons.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>When he was done, he mustered his\nresolution for an exploration of his situation. He wanted to know what kind of\nplace he was in. Carefully, tentatively, he began searching away from the\nslopes on his hands and knees.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Before he had moved three feet\nacross flat stone, he found a body. The flesh yielded as if it had not been\ndead long, but its chest was cold and slick, and his hand came back wet,\nsmelling of rotten blood He recoiled to the slope, gritted himself into\nmotionlessness while his lungs heaved loudly and his knees trembled. The\nur-vile, the ur-vile that had attacked him. Broken by the fall. He wanted to\nmove, but could not. The shock of discovery froze him like a sudden opening of\ndangerous doors; he felt surrounded by perils which he could not name. How had\nthat creature known to attack him? Could it actually smell white gold?</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Then his ring began to gleam. The\nbloody radiation transformed it into a band of dull fire about his wedding\nfinger, a crimson fetter. But it shed no light-did not even enable him to see\nthe digit on which it hung. It shone balefully in front of him, exposed him to\nany eyes that were hidden in the dark, but it gave him nothing but dread.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>He could not forget what it meant.\nDrool's bloody moon was rising full over the Land.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>It made him quail against the\nshale slope. He had a gagging sensation in his throat, as if he were being\nforce-fed terror. Even the uncontrollable wheeze of his respiration seemed to\nmark him for attack by claws and fangs so invisible in the darkness that he\ncould not visualize them. He was alone, helpless, abject.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Unless he found some way to make\nuse of the power of his ring.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>He fell back in revulsion from\nthat thought the instant it crossed his mind. No! Never! He was a leper;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>his capacity for survival\ndepended-on a complete recognition, acceptance, of his essential impotence.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>That was the law of leprosy.\nNothing could be as fatal to him-nothing could destroy him body and mind as\npainfully-as the illusion of power. Power in a dream. And before he died he\nwould become as fetid and deformed as that man he had met in the leprosarium.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>No!</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Better to kill himself outright.\nAnything would be better.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>He did not know how long he spun\ngiddily before he heard a low noise in the darkness-distant, slippery and\nominous, as if the surrounding midnight had begun breathing softly through its\nteeth. It stunned him like a blow to the heart. Flinching in blind fear, he\ntried to fend it off. Slowly, it grew clearer-a quiet, susurrus sound like a\ngritted exhalation from many throats. It infested the air like vermin, made his\nflesh crawl.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>They were coming for him. They\nknew where he was because of his ring, and they were coming for him.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>He had a quick vision of a Waynhim\nwith an iron spike through its chest. He clapped his right hand over his ring.\nBut he knew that was futile as soon as he did it. Frenetically, he began\nsearching over the shale for some kind of weapon. Then he remembered his knife.\nIt felt too weightless to help him. But he gripped it, and went on hunting with\nhis right hand, hardly knowing what he sought.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>For a long moment, he fumbled\naround him, regardless of the noise he made. Then his fingers found his staff.\nBannor must have dropped it, and it had fallen near him.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The susurration drew nearer. It\nwas the sound of many bare feet sliding over stone. They were coming for him.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The staff! it was a Hirebrand's\nstaff. Baradakas had given it to him. In the hour of darkness, remember the\nHirebrand's staff. If he could light it.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>But how?</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The black air loomed with enemies.\nTheir steps seemed to slide toward him from above.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>How? he cried desperately, trying\nto make the staff catch fire by sheer force of will. Baradakas! Still the feet\ncame closer. He could hear hoarse breathing behind their sibilant approach.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>It had burned for him at the\nCelebration of Spring. Shaking with haste, he pressed the end of the staff to\nhis bloodembered ring. At once, red flame blossomed on the wood, turned pale\norange and yellow,</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>flared up brightly. The sudden\nlight dazzled him, but he leaped to his feet and held the staff over his head.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>He was standing at the bottom of a\nlong slope which filled half the floor of the crevice. This loose piled shale\nhad saved his life by giving under the impact of his fall, rolling him down\ninstead of holding him where he hit. Before and behind him, the crevice\nstretched upward far beyond the reach of his flame. Nearby, the ur-vile lay\ntwisted on its back, its black skin wet with blood.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Shuffling purposefully toward him\nalong the crevice floor was a disjointed company of Cavewights.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>They were still thirty yards away,\nbut even at that distance, he was surprised by their appearance. They did not\nlook like other Cavewights he had seen. The difference was not only in costume,\nthough these creatures were ornately and garishly caparisoned like a royal\ncadre, elite and obscene. They were physically different. They were old-old\nprematurely, unnaturally. Their red eyes were hooded, and their</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>long limbs bent as if the bones\nhad been warped in a short time. Their heads sagged on necks that still looked\nthick enough to be strong and erect. Their heavy, spatulate hands trembled as\nif with palsy. Together, they reeked of ill, of victimization. But they came\nforward with clenched determination, as if they had been promised the peace of\ndeath when this last task was done.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Shaking off his surprise, he\nbrandished his staff threateningly. &quot;Don't touch me!&quot; he hissed\nthrough his teeth. &quot;Back off! I made a bargain-!&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The Cavewights gave no sign that\nthey had heard. But they did not attack him. When they were almost within his\nreach, they spread out on both sides, awkwardly encircled him. Then, by giving\nway on one side and closing toward him on the other, they herded him in the\ndirection from which they had come.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>As soon as he understood that they\nwished to take him someplace without a fight, he began to cooperate. He knew\nintuitively where they were going. So through their tortuous herding he moved\nslowly along the crevice until he reached a stair in the left wall. It was a\nrude way, roughly hacked out of the rock, but it was wide enough for several\nCavewights to climb abreast. He was able to control his vertigo by staying near\nthe wall, away from the crevice.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>They ascended for several hundred\nfeet before they reached an opening in the wall. Though the stairs continued\nupward, the Cavewights steered him through this opening. He found himself in a\nnarrow tunnel with a glow of rocklight at its end. The creatures marched him\nmore briskly now, as if they were hurrying him toward a scaffold.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Then a wash of heat and a stink of\nbrimstone poured over him. He stepped out of the tunnel into Kiril Threndor.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>He recognized the burnished stone\ngleam of the faceted walls, the fetid stench like sulfur consuming rotten\nflesh, the several entrances, the burning dance of light on the clustered\nstalactites high overhead. It was all as vivid to him as if it had just been\ntranslated from a nightmare. The Cavewights ushered him into the chamber, then\nstood behind him to block the entrance.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>For the second time, he met Drool\nRockworm.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Drool crouched on his low dais in\nthe center of the cave. He clenched the Staff of Law in both his huge hands,\nand it was by the Staff that Covenant first recognized him. Drool had changed.\nSome blight had fallen on him. As he caught sight of Covenant, he began\nlaughing shrilly. But his voice was weak, and his laughter had a pitch of\nhysteria. He did not laugh long; he seemed too exhausted to sustain it. Like\nthe Cavewights who had herded Covenant, he was old.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>But whatever had damaged them had\nhurt him more. His limbs were so gnarled that he could hardly stand; saliva ran\nuncontrolled from his drooping lips; and he was sweating profusely, as if he\ncould no longer endure the heat of his own domain. He gripped the Staff in an\nattitude of fierce possessiveness and desperation. Only his eyes had not\nchanged. They shone redly, without iris or pupil, and seemed to froth like\nmalicious lava, eager to devour.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant felt a strange mixture of\npity and loathing. But he had only a moment to wonder what had happened to\nDrool. Then he had to brace himself. The Cavewight began hobbling painfully\ntoward him.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Groaning at the ache in his limbs,\nDrool stopped a few paces from Covenant. He released one hand from the\nintricately runed Staff to point a trembling finger at Covenant's wedding band.\nWhen he spoke, he cast continual, twitching leers back over his shoulder, as if\nreferring to an invisible spectator. His voice</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>was as gnarled and wracked as his\narms and legs.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Mine!&quot; he coughed.\n&quot;You promised. Mine. Lord Drool, Staff and ring. You promised. Do this,\nyou said. Do that. Do not crush. Wait now.&quot; He spat viciously. &quot;Kill\nlater. You promised. The ring if I did what you said. You said.&quot; He\nsounded like a sick child. &quot;Drool. Lord Drool! Power! Mine now.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Slavering thickly, he reached a\nhand for Covenant's Wig.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant reacted in instant\nrevulsion. With his burning staff, he struck a swift blow, slapped Drool's hand\naway.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>At the impact, his staff broke\ninto slivers as if Drool's flesh were vehement iron.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>But Drool gave a coughing roar of\nrage, and stamped the heel of the Staff of Law on the floor. The stone jumped\nunder Covenant's feet; he pitched backward, landed with a jolt that seemed to\nstop his heart.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>He lay stunned and helpless.\nThrough a throbbing noise in his ears, he heard Drool cry, &quot;Slay him! Give\nthe ring!&quot; He rolled over. Sweat blurred his vision; blearily, he saw the\nCavewights converging toward him. His heart felt paralyzed in his chest, and he\nF could not get his feet under him. Retching for air, he tried to crawl out of\nreach.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The first Cavewight caught hold of\nhis neck, then abruptly groaned and fell away to the side. Another Cavewight\nfell; the rest drew back in confusion. One of them cried fearfully,\n&quot;Bloodguard! Lord Drool, help us!&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Fool!&quot; retorted Drool,\ncoughing as if his lungs were in shreds. &quot;Coward! I am power! Slay\nthem!&quot; Covenant climbed to his feet, wiped the sweat from his eyes, and\nfound Bannor standing beside him.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The Bloodguard's robe hung\ntattered from his shoulders, and a large bruise on his brow closed one eye.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>But his hands were poised, alert.\nHe carried himself on the balls of his feet, ready to leap in any direction.\nHis flat eyes held a dull gleam of battle.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant felt such a surge of\nrelief that he wanted to hug Bannor. After his long, lightless ordeal, he felt\nsuddenly rescued, almost redeemed. But his gruff voice belied his emotion.\n&quot;What the hell took you so long?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The Cavewights came forward\nslowly, timorously, and surrounded Covenant and Bannor. Drool raged at them in\nhoarse gasps.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Overhead, the chiaroscuro of the\nstalactites danced gaily.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>With startling casualness, Bannor\nreplied that he had landed badly after killing the ur-vile, and had lost\nconsciousness. Then he had been unable to locate Covenant in the darkness.\nLashed by Drool's strident commands, a Cavewight charged Covenant from behind.\nBut Bannor spun easily, felled the creature with a kick. &quot;The flame of\nyour staff revealed you,&quot; he continued. &quot;I chose to follow.&quot; He\npaused to spring at two of the nearest attackers. They retreated hastily. When\nhe spoke again, his foreign Haruchai tone held a note of final honesty. &quot;I\nwithheld my aid, awaiting proof that you are not a foe of the Lords.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Something in the selfless and\ncasual face that Bannor turned toward death communicated itself to Covenant. He\nanswered without rancor, &quot;You picked a fine time to test me.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;The Bloodguard know doubt.\nWe require to be sure.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Drool mustered his strength to\nshriek furiously, &quot;Fools! Worms! Afraid of only two!&quot; He spat.\n&quot;Go! Watch! Lord Drool kills.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The Cavewights gave way, and Drool\ncame wincing forward. He held the Staff of Law before him like an ax.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Bannor leaped, launched a kick at\nDrool's face.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>But for all his crippled\ncondition, Drool Rockworm was full of power. He did not appear to feel Bannor's\nattack. In ponderous fury, he raised the Staff to deal a blast which would\nincinerate Bannor and Covenant where they stood. Against the kind of might he\nwielded, they were helpless.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Still Bannor braced himself in\nfront of Covenant to meet the blow. Flinching, Covenant waited for the pain\nthat would set him free.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>But Drool was already too late. He\nhad missed his chance, neglected other dangers. Even as he raised the Staff, the\ncompany of the Quest, led by First Mark Tuvor and High Lord Prothall, broke\ninto Kiril Threndor.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>They looked battered, as if they\nhad just finished a skirmish with Drool's outer defenses, but they were whole\nand dour-handed, and they entered the chamber like a decisive wave. Prothall\nstopped Drool's blast with a shout full of authority. Before the Cavewights\ncould gather themselves together, the Eoman fell on them, drove them from the\ncave. In a moment, Drool was surrounded by a wide ring of warriors and\nBloodguard.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Slowly, with an appearance of\nconfusion, he retreated until he was half-crouching on his dais. He looked\naround the circle as if unable to realize what had happened. But his spatulate\nhands held the Staff in a grip as grim as death.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Then, grotesquely, his laval eyes\ntook on an angle of cunning. Twitching nods over his shoulder, he hissed in a\nraw voice, &quot;Here-this is fair. Fair. Better than promises. All of\nthem-here. All little Lords and puny Bloodguard-humans. Ready for\ncrushing.&quot; He started to laugh, broke into a fit of coughing.\n&quot;Crush!&quot; he spat when he regained control of himself. &quot;Crush\nwith power.&quot; He made a noise like a cracking of bones in his throat.\n&quot;Power! Little Lords. Mighty Drool. Better than promises.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Prothall faced the Cavewight\nsquarely. Giving his staff to Mhoram, he stepped forward to the dais with Tuvor\nat his side. He stood erect; his countenance was calm and clear. Supported by\ntheir years of abnegation, his eyes neither wavered nor burned. In contrast,\nDrool's red orbs were consumed with the experience of innumerable satiations-an\naddictive gluttony of power. When the High Lord spoke, even the rattle of his\nold voice sounded like authority and decision. Softly, he said, &quot;Give it\nup. Drool Rockworm, hear me. The Staff of Law is not yours. It is not meant for\nyou. Its strength must only be used for the health of the Land. Give it to\nme.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant moved to stand near the\nHigh Lord. He felt that he had to be near the Staff.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>But Drool only muttered,\n&quot;Power? Give it up? Never.&quot; His lips went on moving, as if he were\ncommuning over secret plans.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Again, Prothall urged,\n&quot;Surrender it. For your own sake. Are you blind to yourself? Do you not\nsee what has happened to you? This power is not meant for you. It destroys you.\nYou have used the Staff wrongly. You have used the Illearth Stone. Such powers\nare deadly. Lord Foul has betrayed you. Give the Staff to me. I will strive to\nhelp you.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>But that idea offended Drool.\n&quot;Help?&quot; he coughed. &quot;Fool! I am Lord Drool. Master! The moon is\nmine. Power is mine. You are mine. I can crush! Old man-little Lord. I let you\nlive to make me laugh. Help? No, dance. Dance for Lord Drool.&quot; He waved'\nthe Staff threateningly. &quot;Make me laugh. I let you live.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Prothall drew himself up, and said\nin a tone of command, &quot;Drool Rockworm, release the Staff.&quot; He\nadvanced a step.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>With a jerk like a convulsion of\nhysteria, Drool raised the Staff to strike.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Prothall rushed forward, tried to\nstop him. But Tuvor reached the Cavewight first. He caught the end of the\nStaff.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Shivering with rage, Drool jabbed\nthe iron heel of the Staff against Tuvor's body. Bloody light flashed. In that\ninstant the First Mark's flesh became transparent; the company could see his\nbones burning like dry sticks. Then he fell, reeling backward to collapse in\nCovenant's arms.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>His weight was too great for the\nUnbeliever to hold; Covenant sank to the stone under it. Cradling Tuvor, he\nwatched the High Lord.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Prothall grappled with Drool. He\ngrasped the Staff with both hands to prevent Drool from striking him. They\nwrestled together for possession of it.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The struggle looked impossible for\nProthall. Despite his decrepitude, Drool retained some of his Cave-wightish\nstrength. And he was full of power. And Prothall was old.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>With Tuvor in his arms, Covenant\ncould do nothing. &quot;Help him!&quot; he cried to Mhoram. &quot;He'll be\nkilled!&quot; But Lord Mhoram turned his back on Prothall. He knelt beside\nCovenant to see if he could aid Tuvor.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>As he examined the First Mark, he\nsaid roughly, &quot;Drool seeks to master the Staff with malice. The High Lord\ncan sing a stronger song than that.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Appalled, Covenant shouted,\n&quot;He'll be killed! You've got to help him!&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Help him?&quot; Mhoram's\neyes glinted dangerously. Pain and raw restraint sharpened his voice as he\nsaid, &quot;He would not welcome my help. He is the High Lord. Despite my\nOath&quot;-he choked momentarily on a throat full of passion-&quot;I would\ncrush Drool.&quot; He invested Drool's word, crush, with a potential for\ndespair that silenced Covenant.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Panting, Covenant watched the High\nLord's fight. He was horrified by the danger, by the price both Lords were\nwilling to pay.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Then battle erupted around him.\nCavewights charged into Kiril Threndor from several directions. Apparently,\nDrool had been able to send out a silent call; his guards were answering. The\nfirst forces to reach the chamber were not large, but they sufficed to engage\nthe whole company. Only Mhoram did not join the fight. He knelt beside Covenant\nand stroked the First Mark's face, as if he were transfixed by Tuvor's dying.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Shouting stertorously over the\nclash of weapons, Quaan ordered his warriors into a defensive ring around the\ndais and the Lords. Loss and fatigue had taken their toll on the Eoman, but\nstalwart Quaan led his command as if the Lords' need rendered him immune to\nweakness. Among the Bloodguard, his Eoman parried, thrust, fought on the spur\nof his exhortations.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The mounting perils made Covenant\nreel. Prothall and Drool struggled horribly above him. The fighting around him\ngrew faster and more frenzied by the moment. Tuvor lay expiring in his lap. And\nhe could do nothing about any of it, help none of them. Soon their escape would\nbe cut off, and all their efforts would be in vain.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>He had not foreseen this outcome\nto his bargain.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Drool bore Prothall slowly\nbackward. &quot;Dance!&quot; he raged.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Tuvor shuddered; his eyes opened.\nCovenant looked away from Prothall. Tuvor's lips moved, but he made no sound.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Mhoram tried to comfort him.\n&quot;Have no fear. This evil will be overcome-it is in the High Lord's hands.\nAnd your name will be remembered with honor wherever trust is valued.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>But Tuvor's eyes held Covenant,\nand he managed to whisper one word, &quot;True?&quot; His whole body strained\nwith supplication, but Covenant did not know whether he asked for a promise or\na judgment.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Yet the Unbeliever answered. He\ncould not refuse a Bloodguard, could not deny the appeal of such expensive\nfidelity. The word stuck in his throat, but he forced it out. &quot;Yes.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Tuvor shuddered again, and died\nwith a flat groan as if the chord of his Vow had snapped. Covenant gripped his\nshoulders, shook him; there was no response.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>On the dais, Drool had forced\nProthall to his knees, and was bending the High Lord back to break him. In\nfutility and rage, Covenant howled, &quot;Mhoram!&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The Lord nodded, surged to his\nfeet. But he did not attack Drool. Holding his staff over his head, he blared\nin a voice that cut through the clamor of the battle, &quot;Melenkurion abatha!\nMinas mill khabaal!&quot; From end to end, his staff burst into incandescent\nfire.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The power of the Words jolted\nDrool, knocked him back a step. Prothall regained his feet.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>More Cavewights rushed into Kiril\nThrendor. Quaan and his Eoman were driven back toward the dais. At last, Mhoram\nsprang to their aid. His staff burned furiously as he attacked. Around him, the\nBloodguard fought like wind devils, leaping and kicking among the Cavewights so\nswiftly that the creatures interfered with each other when they tried to strike\nback.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>But Drool's defenders kept coming,\npouring into the cave. The company began to founder in the rising onslaught.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Then Prothall cried over the din,\n&quot;I have it! The moon is free!&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>He stood triumphant on the dais,\nwith the Staff of Law upraised in his hands. Drool lay at his feet, sobbing\nlike apiece of broken rock. Between spasms of grief, the creature gasped,\n&quot;Give it back. I want</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>it.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The sight struck fear into the\nCavewights. They recoiled, quailed back against the walls of the chamber.\nReleased from battle, Quaan and his warriors turned toward Prothall and gave a\nraw cheer. Their voices were hoarse and worn, but they exulted in the High\nLord's victory as if he had won the future of the Land.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Yet overhead the dancing lights of\nKiril Threndor went their own bedizened way.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant snapped a look at his\nring. Its argent still burned with blood. Perhaps the moon was free; he was\nnot.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Before the echoes of cheering\ndied-before anyone could move-a new sound broke over them. It started softly,\nthen expanded until it filled the chamber like a collapse of the ceiling. It\nwas laughter -Lord Foul's laughter, throbbing with glee and immitigable hate.\nIts belittling weight dominated them, buried them in their helplessness; it\nparalyzed them, seemed to cut them off from their own heartbeats and breathing.\nWhile it piled onto them, they were lost.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Even Prothall stood still. Despite\nhis victory, he looked old and feeble, and his eyes had an unfocused stare as\nif he were gazing into his own coffin. And Covenant, who knew that laugh, could\nnot resist it.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>But Lord Mhoram moved. Springing\nonto the dais, he whirled his staff around his head until the air hummed, and\nblue lightning bolted upward into the clustered stalactites. &quot;Then show\nyourself, Despiser!&quot; he shouted. &quot;If you are so certain, face us nowl\nDo you fear to try your doom with us?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Lord Foul's laughter exploded with\nfiercer contempt. But Mhoram's defiance had broken its transfixion. Prothall\ntouched Mhoram's shoulder. The warriors gripped their swords, placed themselves\nin grim readiness behind the Lords.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>More Cavewights entered the\nchamber, though they did not attack. At the sight of them, Drool raised himself\non his crippled arms. His bloody eyes boiled still, clinging to fury and malice\nto the end. Coughing as if he were about to heave up his heart, he gasped,\n&quot;The Staff. You do not know. Cannot use it. Fools. No escape. None. I have\narmies. I have the Stone.&quot; With a savage effort, he made himself heard\nthrough the laughter. &quot;Illearth Stone. Power and power. I will crush.\nCrush.&quot; Flailing one weak arm at his guards,</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>he screamed in stricken command,\n&quot;Crush!&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Wielding their weapons, the Cavewights\nsurged forward.<br clear=all style='page-break-before:always'>\n</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><a name=\"_Toc370739029\"><span class=Heading1Char><span\nstyle='font-size:16.0pt;line-height:105%'>TWENTY-FOUR: The Calling of Lions</span></span></a></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>They came in a mass of red eyes\ndull with empty determination. But Lord Foul's bodiless laughter seemed to slow\nthem. They waded through it as if it were a quagmire, and their difficult\napproach gave the company time to react. At Quaan's command, the warriors\nringed Mhoram and Prothall. The Bloodguard took fighting positions with the\nEoman.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Mhoram called to Covenant.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Slowly, Covenant raised his head.\nHe looked at his companions, and they seemed pitifully few to him.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>He tried to get to his feet. But\nTuvor was too heavy for him to lift. Even in death, the massive devotion o the\nFirst Mark surpassed his strength.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>He heard Manethrall Lithe shout,\n&quot;This way! I know the way!&quot; She was dodging among the Cave-wights\ntoward one of the entrances. He watched her go as if he had already forsaken\nher. He could not lift Tuvor because he could not get a grip with his right\nhand; two fingers were not enough.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Then Bannor snatched him away from\nthe fallen First Mark, thrust him toward the protective ring of the Eoman.\nCovenant resisted. &quot;You can't leave him!&quot; But Bannor forced him among\nthe warriors. &quot;What are you doing?&quot; he protested. &quot;We've got to\ntake him along. If you don't send him back, he won't be replaced.&quot; He spun\nto appeal to the Lords. &quot;You can't leave him!&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Mhoram's lips stretched taut over\nhis teeth. &quot;We must.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>From the mouth of the tunnel she\nhad chosen, Lithe called, &quot;Here!&quot; She clenched her cord around a\nCavewight's neck, and used the creature's body to protect herself from attack.\n&quot;This is the way!&quot; Other Cavewights converged on her, forced her\nbackward.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>In response, Prothall lit his old\nstaff, swung it, and led a charge toward her. With Mhoram's help, he burned\npassage for his companions through the massed Cavewights.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Bright Lords-fire intimidated the\ncreatures. But before the company had gained the tunnel Lithe had chosen, a\nwedge of ur-viles drove snarling into the chamber from a nearby entrance. They\nwere led by a mighty loremaster, as black as the catacombs, wielding an iron\nstave that looked wet with power or blood.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Prothall cried, &quot;Runt&quot;\nThe Questers dashed for the tunnel. The ur-viles raced to intercept them.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The company was faster. Prothall\nand Mhoram gained the passage, and parted to let the others enter between them.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>But one of the warriors decided to\nhelp his comrades escape. He suddenly veered away from the Eoman. Whirling his\nsword fervidly, he threw himself at the ur-vile wedge.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Mhoram yelled, started back out\ninto the chamber to help him. But the loremaster brushed the warrior aside with\na slap of its stave, and he fell. Dark moisture covered him from head to foot;\nhe screamed as if he had been drenched in acid. Mhoram barely evaded the\nstave's backstroke, retreated to Prothall's side in the mouth of the passage.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>There they tried to stand. They\nopposed their blazing blue flame to the ur-viles. The loremaster struck at them\nagain and again; they blocked each blow with their staffs; gouts of flaming\nfluid, igniting blue and then turning quickly black, spattered on all sides at\nevery clash. But the wedge fought with a savagery which drove the Lords\nbackward step by step into the tunnel.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Quaan tried to counter by having\nhis strongest archers loose arrows at the loremaster. But the shafts</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>were useless. They caught fire in\nthe ur-viles' black power and burned to ashes.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Behind the company, Lithe was\nchaffing to pursue the guide of her instinct for daylight. She called\nrepeatedly for the Lords to follow her. But they could not; they did not dare\nturn their backs on the wedge.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Each clash drove them backward.\nFor all their courage and resolve, they were nearly exhausted, and every blow\nof the loremaster's stave weakened them further. Now their flame had a less\nrampant blaze, and the burning gouts turned black more swiftly. It was clear,\nthat they could not keep up the fight. And no one in the company could take it\nfor them.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Abruptly, Mhoram shouted,\n&quot;Back! Make room!&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>His urgency allowed no refusal;\neven the Bloodguard obeyed. &quot;Covenant!&quot; Mhoram cried.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant moved forward until he\nwas only an arm's length from the searing battle. &quot;Raise your ring!&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Compelled by Mhoram's intensity,\nthe Unbeliever lifted his left hand. A crimson cast still stained the heart of\nhis wedding band.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The loremaster observed the ring\nas if suddenly smelling its presence. It recognized white gold, hesitated. The\nwedge halted, though the loremaster did not drop its guard.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Melenkurion abatha!&quot;\nMhoram commanded. &quot;Blast them!&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Half intuitively, Covenant\nunderstood. He jabbed at the loremaster with his left fist as if launching a\nbolt. Barking in strident fear, the whole wedge recoiled.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>In that instant, the Lords acted.\nShouting, &quot;Minas mill khaball!&quot; on different pitches in half-screamed\nharmony, they drew with their fire an X which barricaded the tunnel from top to\nbottom. The flame of the X hung in the air; and before it could die, Prothall\nplaced his staff erect within it. At once, a sheet of blue flared in the\npassage.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Howling in rage at Mhoram's ruse,\nthe ur-viles sprang forward. The loremaster struck hugely at the flame with its\nstave. The fiery wall rippled and fluttered -but did not let the wedge pass.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Prothall and Mhoram took only a\nmoment to see how their power held. Then they turned and dashed down the\ntunnel.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Gasping for breath, Mhoram told\nthe company, &quot;We have forbidden the tunnel! But it will not endure. We are\nnot strong enough-the High Lord's staff was needed to make any forbidding at\nall. And the ur-viles are savage. Drool drives them mad with the Illearth\nStone.&quot; In spite of his haste, his voice carried a shudder. &quot;Now we\nmust run. We must escape-must! All our work will go for nothing if we do not\ntake both Staff and Ward to safety.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Come!&quot; the Manethrall\nresponded. &quot;I know grass and sky. I can find the way.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Prothall nodded agreement, but his\nmovements were slow, despite the need for alacrity. He was exhausted, driven\nfar past the normal limits of his stamina. With his breath rattling deep in his\nchest as if he were drowning in the phlegm of his age, he leaned heavily on the\nStaff of Law. &quot;Go!&quot; he panted. &quot;Run!&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Two Bloodguard took his arms, and\nbetween them he stumbled into a slow run down the passage. Rallying around him,\nthe company started away after Lithe.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>At first, they went easily. Their\ntunnel offered few branchings; at each of these, Lithe seemed instantly sure\nwhich held the greatest promise of daylight. Lit from behind by Mhoram's staff,\nshe loped forward as if following a warm trail of freedom.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>After the struggles of close\ncombat, the company found relief in simple, single-minded running. It allowed\nthem to focus and conserve their strength. Furthermore, they were passing, as\nif slowly liberated, out of the range of Lord Foul's laughter. Soon they could\nhear neither mockery nor threat of slaughter at their backs. For once, the\nsilent darkness befriended them.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>For nearly a league, they hastened\nonward. They began to traverse a section of the catacombs which was intricate\nwith small caves and passages and turnings, but which appeared to contain no\nlarge halls, crevices, wightworks. Throughout these multiplied corridors, Lithe\ndid not hesitate. Several times she took ways which inclined slowly upward.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>But as the complex tunnels opened\ninto broader and blacker ways, where Mhoram's flame illumined no cave walls or\nceilings, the catacombs became more hostile. Gradually, the silence\nchanged-lost the hue of relief, and became the hush of ambush. The darkness\naround Mhoram's light seemed to conceal more and more. At the turnings and\nintersections, night thickened in their choices, clouding Lithe's instinct. She\nbegan to falter.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Behind her, Prothall grew less and\nless able to keep up the pace. His hoarse, wheezing breath was increasingly\nlabored; even the weariest Questers could hear his gasps over their own hard\npanting. The Bloodguard were almost carrying him.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Still they pushed on into stark\nmidnight. They bore the Staff of Law and the Second Ward, and could not afford\nsurrender.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Then they reached a high cave\nwhich formed a crossroads for several tunnels. The general direction they had\nmaintained since Kiril Threndor was continued by one passage across the cave.\nBut Lithe stopped in the center of the junction as if she had been reined to a\nhalt. She searched about her uncertainly, confused by the number of her\nchoices-and by some intuitive rejection of her only obvious selection. Shaking\nher head as if resisting a bit, she groaned, &quot;Ah, Lords. I do not\nknow.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Mhoram snapped, &quot;You\n&quot;must! We have no other chance. The old maps do not show these ways. You\nhave led us far beyond our ken.&quot; He gripped her shoulder as if he meant to\nforce her decision. But the next moment he was distracted by Prothall. With a\nsharp spasm of coughing, the High Lord collapsed to the floor.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>One Bloodguard quickly propped him\ninto a sitting position, and Mhoram knelt beside him, peering with intent\nconcern into his old face. &quot;Rest briefly,&quot; mumbled Mhoram. &quot;Our\nforbidding has long since broken. We must not delay.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Between fits of coughing, the High\nLord replied, &quot;Leave me. Take the Staff and go. I am done.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>His words appalled the company.\nCovenant and the warriors covered their own breathing to hear Mhoram's answer.\nThe air was suddenly intense with a fear that Mhoram would accept Prothall's\nsacrifice.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>But Mhoram said nothing.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Leave me,&quot; Prothall\nrepeated. &quot;Give your staff to me, and I will defend your retreat as I can.\nGo, I say. I am old. I have had my time of triumph. I lose nothing. Take the\nStaff and go.&quot; When the Lord still did not speak, he rattled in\nsupplication, &quot;Mhoram, hear me. Do not let my old bones destroy this high\nQuest.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;I hear you.&quot; Mhoram's\nvoice sounded thick and wounded in his throat. He knelt with his head bowed.\nBut a moment later he rose to his feet, and put back his head, and began to\nlaugh. It was quiet laughter unfeverish and unforced-the laughter of relief and\nindespair. The company gaped at it until they understood that it was not\nhysteria. Then, without knowing why, they laughed in response. Humor ran like a\nclean wind through their hearts.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant almost cursed aloud\nbecause he could not share it.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>When they had subsided into low\nchuckling, Mhoram said to the High Lord, &quot;Ah, Prothall son of Dwillian. It\nis good that you are old. Leave you? How will I be able to take pleasure in\ntelling Osondrea of your great exploits if you are not there to protest my\nboasting?&quot; Gaily, he laughed again. Then, as if recollecting himself, he\nreturned to where Lithe stood bewildered in the center of the cave.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Manethrall,&quot; he said\ngently, &quot;you have done well. Your instinct is true-remember it now. Put\nall doubt away. We do not fear to follow where your heart leads.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant had noticed that she,\ntoo, had not joined the laughter of the company. Her eyes were troubled; he\nguessed that her swift blood had been offended by Mhoram's earlier sharpness.\nBut she nodded gravely to the Lord. &quot;That is well. My thoughts do not\ntrust my heart.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;In what way?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;My thoughts say that we must\ncontinue as we have come. But my heart wishes to go there.&quot; She indicated\na tunnel opening back almost in the direction from which- they had come.\n&quot;I do not know,&quot; she concluded simply. &quot;This is new to me.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>But Mhoram's reply held no\nhesitation. &quot;You are Manethrall Lithe of the Ramen. You have served the\nRanyhyn. You know grass and sky. Trust your heart.&quot; After a moment, Lithe\naccepted his counsel.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Two Bloodguard helped Prothall to\nhis feet. Supporting him between them, they joined the company and followed\nLithe's instinct into the tunnel.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>This passage soon began to descend\nslowly, and they set a good pace down it. They were buoyed along by the hope\nthat their pursuers would not guess what they were doing, and so would neither\ncut them off nor follow them directly. But in the universal darkness and\nsilence, they had no assurances. Their</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>way met no branchings, but it\nwavered as if it were tracing a vein in the mountain. Finally it opened into a\nvast impression of blank space, and began to climb a steep, serrated rock face\nthrough a series of switchbacks. Now the company had to toil upward.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The difficulties of the ascent\nslowed them as much as the climbing. The higher they went, the colder the air\nbecame, and the more there seemed to be a wind blowing in the dark gulf beside\nthem. But the cold and the wind only accented their dripping sweat and the\nexhausted wrack of their respiration. The Bloodguard alone appeared unworn by\nthe long days of their exertion; they strode steadily up the slope as if it\nwere just a variation of their restless devotion. But their companions were\nmore deathprone. The warriors and Covenant began to stagger like cripples in\nthe climb.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Finally Mhoram called a halt.\nCovenant dropped to sit with his back to the rock, facing the black-blown,\nmeasureless cavern. The sweat seemed to freeze on his face. The last of the\nfood and drink was passed around, but in this buried place, both appeared to\nhave lost their capacity to refresh-as if at last even sustenance were daunted\nby the darkness of the catacombs. Covenant ate and drank numbly. Then he shut\nhis eyes to close out the empty blackness for a time. But he saw it whether his\neyes were open or not.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Some time later-Covenant no longer\nmeasured duration-Lord Mhoram said in a stinging whisper, &quot;I hear\nthem.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Korik's reply sounded as hollow as\na sigh from a tomb. &quot;Yes. They follow. They are a great many.&quot;\nLurching as if stricken, the Questers began to climb again, pushing themselves\nbeyond the limits of their strength. They felt weak with failure, as if they\nwere moving only because Mhoram's blue flame pulled them forward, compelled\nthem, beseeched, cajoled, urged, inspired, refused to accept anything from them\nexcept endurance and more endurance. Disregarding every exigency except the\nneed for escape, they continued to climb.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Then the wind began to howl around\nthem, and their way changed. The chasm abruptly narrowed; they found themselves\non a thin, spiral stair carved into the wall of a vertical shaft. The width of\nthe rude steps made them ascend in single file. And the wind went yelling up\nthe shaft as if it fled the catacombs in stark terror. Covenant groaned when he\nrealized that he would have to risk yet another perilous height, but the rush\nof the wind was so powerful that it seemed to make falling impossible. Cycling\ndizzily, he struggled up the stair.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The shaft went straight upward,\nand the wind yowled in pain; and the company climbed as if they were being\ndragged by the air. But as the shaft narrowed, the force of the wind increased;\nthe air began to move past them too fast for breathing. As they gasped upward,\na light-headed vertigo came over them. The shaft seemed to cant precariously\nfrom side to side. Covenant moved on his hands and knees.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Soon the whole company was\ncrawling.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>After an airless ache which\nextended interminably around him, Covenant lay stretched out on the stairs. He\nwas not moving. Dimly, he heard voices trying to shout over the roar of the\nwind. But he was past listening. He felt that he had reached the verge of\nsuffocation, and the only thing he wanted to do was weep. He could hardly\nremember what prevented him even now from releasing his misery.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Hands grabbed his shoulders,\nhauled him up onto flat stone. They dragged him ten or fifteen feet along the\nbottom of a thin crevice. The howl of the wind receded.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>He heard Quaan give a choked,\npanting cheer. With an effort, he raised his head. He was sprawled in the\ncrevice where it opened on one of the eastern faces of Mount Thunder. Across a\nflat, gray expanse far below him, the sun rose redly.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>To his stunned ears, the cheering\nitself sounded like sobs. It spread as the warriors one by one climbed out past\nhim into the dawn. Lithe had already leaped down a few feet from the crevice,\nand was on her knees kissing the earth. Far away, across the Sarangrave and the\ngleaming line of the Defiles Course and the Great Swamp, the sun stood up\nregally, wreathed in red splendor.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant pushed himself into a\nsitting position and looked over at the Lords to see their victory.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>They had no aspect of triumph. The\nHigh Lord sat crumpled like a sack of old bones, with the Staff of Law on his\nknees. His head was bowed, and he covered his face with both hands. Beside him,\nMhoram stood still and dour, and his eyes were as bleak as a wilderness.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant did not understand.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Then Bannor said, &quot;We can\ndefend here.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Mhoram's reply was 'soft and\nviolent. &quot;How? Drool knows many ways. If we prevent him here, he will\nattack from below-above. He can bring thousands against us.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Then close this gap to delay\nthem.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Mhoram's voice became softer\nstill. &quot;The High Lord has no staff. I cannot forbid the gap alone-I have\nnot the power.-Do you believe that I am strong enough to bring down the walls\nof this crevice? No-not even if I were willing to damage the Earth in that way.\nWe must escape. There-&quot; He pointed down the mountainside with a hand that\ntrembled.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant looked downward. The\ncrevice opened into the bottom of a ravine which ran straight down the side of\nMount Thunder like a knife wound. The spine of this cut was jumbled and tossed\nwith huge rocks-fallen boulders, pieces of the higher cliffs like dead\nfragments of the mountain. And its walls were sheer, unclimbable. The Questers\nwould have to pick their way tortuously along the bottom of the cut for half a\nleague. There the walls gave way, and the ravine dropped over a cliff. When the\ncompany reached the cliff, they would have to try to work around the\nmountainsides until they found another descent.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Still Covenant did not understand.\nHe groaned at the difficulty of the ravine, but it was escape. He could feel\nsunlight on his face. Heaving himself to his feet, he muttered, &quot;Let's get\ngoing.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Mhoram gave him a look thick with\nsuppressed pain. But he did not voice it. Instead, he spoke stiffly to Quaan\nand Korik. In a few moments, the Questers started down the ravine.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Their progress was deadly slow. In\norder to make their way, they had to climb from rock to rock, swing themselves\nover rough boulders, squeeze on hands and knees through narrow gaps between\nhuge fists of stone. And they were weak. The strongest of the warriors needed\nhelp time and again from the Bloodguard.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Prothall had to be almost entirely\ncarried. He clutched the Staff, and scrabbled frailly at the climbs. Whenever\nhe jumped from a rock, he fell to his knees; soon the front of his robe was\nspattered with blood.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant began to sense their\ndanger. Their pace might be fatal. If Drool knew other ways onto the slope, his\nforces might reach the end of the ravine before the company did.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>He was not alone in his\nperception. After their first relief, the warriors took on a haunted look. Soon\nthey were trudging, clambering, struggling with their heads bowed and backs\nbent as if the weight of all they had ever known were tied around their necks.\nThe sunlight did not allow them to be ignorant of their peril.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Like a prophecy, their fear was\nfulfilled before the company was halfway down the ravine. One of the Eoman gave\na broken cry, pointed back up the mountain. There they saw a horde of ur-viles\nrushing out of the cleft from which they had come.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>They tried to push faster down the\nlittered spine of the cut. But the ur-viles poured after them like a black\nflood. The creatures seemed to spring over the rocks without danger of misstep,\nas if borne along by a rush of savagery. They gained on the company with\nsickening speed.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>And the ur-viles were not alone.\nNear the end of the ravine, Cavewights suddenly appeared atop one wall. As soon\nas they spotted the Questers, they began throwing ropes over the edge, scaling\ndown the wall.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The company was caught like a\ngroup of mites in the pincers of Drool's power.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>They stopped where they were,\nparalyzed by dismay. For a moment, even Quaan's sense of responsibility for his\nEoman failed; he stared blankly about him, and did not move. Covenant sagged\nagainst a boulder. He wanted to scream at the mountain that this was not fair.\nHe had already survived so much, endured so much, lost so much. Where was his\nescape? Was this the cost of his bargain, his forbearance? It was too great. He\nwas a leper, not made for such ordeals. His voice shook uncontrollably full of\nuseless outrage. &quot;No wonder he-let us have the Staff. So it would hurt\nworse now. He knew we wouldn't get away with it.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>But Mhoram shouted orders in a\ntone that cut through the dismay. He ran a short way down the ravine and\nclimbed onto a wide, flat rock higher than the others near it. &quot;There is\nspace for us! Come!&quot; he commanded. &quot;We will make our end here!&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Slowly, the warriors shambled to\nthe rock as if they were overburdened with defeat. Mhoram and the Bloodguard\nhelped them up. High Lord Prothall came last, propped between two Bloodguard.\nHe was muttering, &quot;No. No.&quot; But he did not resist Mhoram's orders.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>When everyone was on the rock,\nQuaan's Eoman and the Bloodguard placed themselves around its edge. Lithe\njoined them, her cord taut in her hands, leaving Prothall and Mhoram and\nCovenant in the ring of the company's last defense.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Now the ur-viles had covered half\nthe distance to the rock where the company stood. Behind them came hundreds of\nCavewights, gushing out of the crevice and pouring down the ravine. And as many\nmore worked upward from the place where they had entered the cut.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Surveying Drool's forces, Mhoram\nsaid softly, &quot;Take heart, my friends. You have done well. Now let us make\nour end so bravely that even our enemies will remember it. Do not despair.\nThere are many chances between the onset of a war and victory. Let us teach\nLord Foul that he will never taste victory until the last friend of the Land is\ndead.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>But Prothall whispered, &quot;No.\nNo.&quot; Facing upward toward the crest of Mount Thunder, he planted his feet\nand closed his eyes. With slow resolution, he raised the Staff of Law level\nwith his heart and gripped it in both. fists. &quot;It must be possible,&quot;\nhe breathed. &quot;By the Seven! It must.&quot; His knuckles whitened on the\nintricate runed and secret surface of the Staff. &quot;Melenkurion Skyweir,\nhelp me. I do not accept this end.&quot; His brows slowly knotted over his\nshut, sunken eyes, and his head bowed until his beard touched his heart. From\nbetween his pale lips came a whispered, wordless song. But his voice rattled so\nhuskily in his chest that his song sounded more like a dirge than an\ninvocation.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Drool's forces poured down and\nsurged up at the company inexorably. Mhoram watched them with a rictus of\nhelplessness on his humane lips.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Suddenly, a desperate chance\nblazed in his eyes. He spun, gripped Covenant with his gaze, whispered,\n&quot;There is a way! Prothall strives to call the Fire-Lions. He cannot\nsucceed-the power of the Staff is closed, and we have not the knowledge to\nunlock it. But white gold can release that power. It can be done!&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant recoiled as if Mhoram had\nbetrayed him. No! he panted. I made a bargain-!</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Then, with a sickening,\nvertiginous twist of insight, he caught a glimpse of Lord Foul's plan for him,\nglimpsed what the Despiser was doing to him. Here was the killing blow which\nhad lain concealed behind all the machinations, all the subterfuge.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Hell and blood!</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Here was the point of impact\nbetween his opposing madnesses. If he attempted to use the wild magic if his\nring had power-if it had no power- He flinched at the reel and strike of dark\nvisions-the company slain-the Staff destroyed thousands of creatures dead, all\nthat blood on his head, his head.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;No,&quot; he gasped thickly.\n&quot;Don't ask me. I promised I wouldn't do any more killing. You don't know\nwhat I've done-to Atiaran-to- I made a bargain so I wouldn't have to do any\nmore killing.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The ur-viles and Cavewights were\nalmost within bowshot now. The Eoman had arrows nocked and ready. Drool's\nhordes slowed, began to poise for the last spring of attack.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>But Mhoram's eyes did not release\nCovenant. &quot;There will be still more killing if you do not. Do you believe\nthat Lord Foul will be content with our deaths? Never! He will slay and slay\nagain until all life without exception is his to corrupt or destroy. All life,\ndo you hear? Even these creatures that now serve him will not be spared.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;No!&quot; Covenant groaned\nagain. &quot;Don't you see? This is just what he wants. The Staff will be\ndestroyed or Drool will be destroyed-or we'll- No matter what happens, he'll\nwin. He'll be free. You're doing just what he wants.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Nevertheless!&quot; Mhoram\nreturned fervidly. &quot;The dead are dead-only the living may hope to resist\nDespite.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Hellfire! Covenant groped for\nanswers like a man incapable of his own distress. But he found none. No bargain\nor compromise met his need. In his pain, he cried out wildly, protested,\nappealed, &quot;Mhoram! It's suicide! You're asking me to go crazy!&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The peril in Mhoram's eyes did not\nwaver. &quot;No, Unbeliever. You need not lose your mind. There are</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>other answers other songs. You can\nfind them. Why should the Land be destroyed for your pain? Save or damn! Grasp\nthe Staff!&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Damnation!&quot; Fumbling\nfuriously for his ring, Covenant shouted, &quot;Do it yourself!&quot; He\nwrenched the band from his finger and tried to throw it at Mhoram. But he was\nshaking madly; his fingers slipped. The ring dropped to the stone, rolled away.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>He scrambled after it. He did not\nseem to have enough digits to catch it; it skidded past Prothall's feet. He\nlurched toward it again-then missed his footing, fell, and smacked his forehead\non the stone.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Distantly, he heard the thrum of\nbowstrings; the battle had begun. But he paid no attention. He felt that he had\ncracked his skull. When he raised his head, he found that his vision was wrong;\nhe was seeing double.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The moss-stain chart of his robe\nsmeared illegibly in his sight. Now he had lost whatever chance he had to read\nit, decipher the cryptic message of Morinmoss. He saw two of Mhoram as the Lord\nheld up the ring. He saw two Prothalls above him, clutching the Staff and\ntrying with the last strength of his life-force to compel its power to his\nwill. Two Bannors turned away from the fight toward the Lords.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Then Mhoram stooped to Covenant.\nThe Lord lashed out, caught his right wrist. The grip was so fierce that he\nfelt his bones grinding together. It forced his hand open, and when his two\nfingers were spread and vulnerable, Mhoram shoved the ring onto his index\ndigit. It stuck after the first knuckle. &quot;I cannot usurp your place,&quot;\nthe double Lord grated. He stood and roughly pulled Covenant erect. Thrusting\nhis double face at the Unbeliever, he hissed, &quot;By the Seven! You fear\npower more than weakness.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Yes! Covenant moaned at the pain\nin his wrist and head. Yes! I want to survive!</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The snap of bowstrings came now as\nfast as the warriors could ready their arrows. But their supply of shafts was\nlimited. And the ur-viles and Cavewights hung back, risking themselves only\nenough to draw the warriors' fire. Drool's forces were in no hurry. The\nur-viles particularly looked ready to relish the slow slaughter of the company.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>But Covenant had no awareness to\nspare for such things. He stared in a kind of agony at Mhoram. The Lord seemed\nto-have two mouths-lips stretched over multiplied teeth-and four eyes, all\naflame with compulsions. Because he could think of no other appeal, he reached\nhis free hand to his belt, took out Atiaran's knife, and extended it toward\nMhoram. Through his teeth, he pleaded, &quot;It would be better if you killed\nme.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Slowly, Mhoram's grip eased. His\nlips softened; the fire of his eyes faded. His gaze seemed to turn inward, and\nhe winced at what he beheld. When he spoke, his voice sounded like dust.\n&quot;Ah, Covenant-forgive me. I forget myself. Foamfollower-Foamfollower\nunderstood this. I should have heard him more clearly. It is wrong to ask for\nmore than you give freely. In this way, we come to resemble wha we hate.&quot;\nHe released Covenant's wrist and stepped back. &quot;My friend, this is not on\nyour head. The burden is ours, and we bear it to the end. Forgive me.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant could not answer. He\nstood with his face twisted as if he were about to howl. His eyes ached at the\nduplicity of his vision. Mhoram's mercy affected him more than any argument or\ndemand. He turned miserably toward Prothall. Could he not find somewhere the\nstrength for that risk? Perhaps the path of escape lay that way-perhaps the\nhorror of wild magic was the price he would have to pay for his freedom.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>He did not want to be killed by\nur-viles. But when he raised his arm, he could not tell which of those hands\nwas his, which of those two Staffs was the real one.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Then, with a flat thrum, the last\narrow was gone. The Cavewights gave a vast shout of malice and glee. At the\ncommand of the ur-viles, they began to approach. The warriors drew their\nswords, braced themselves for their useless end. The Bloodguard balanced on the\nballs of their feet.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Trembling, Covenant tried to reach\ntoward the staff. But his head was spinning, and a whirl of darkness jumped\ndizzily at him. He could not overcome his fear; he was appalled at the revenge\nhis leprosy would wreak on him for such audacity. His hand crossed half the\ndistance and stopped, clutched in unfingered impotence at the empty air.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Ah! he cried lornly. Help me!</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;We are the Bloodguard.&quot;\nBannor's voice was almost inaudible through the loud lust of the Cavewights.\n&quot;We cannot permit this end.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Firmly, he took Covenant's hand\nand placed it on the Staff of Law, midway between Prothall's straining\nknuckles.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Power seemed to explode in\nCovenant's chest. A silent concussion, a shock beyond hearing, struck the ravine\nlike a convulsion of the mountain. The blast knocked the Questers from their\nfeet, sent all the urviles and Cavewights sprawling among the boulders. Only\nthe High Lord kept his feet. His head jerked up, and the Staff bucked in his\nhands.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>For a moment, there was stillness\nin the ravine a quiet so intense that the blast seemed to have deafened all the\ncombatants. And in that moment, the entire sky over Gravin Threndor turned\nblack with impenetrable thunder.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Then came noise-one deep bolt of\nsound as if the very rock of the mountain cried out-followed by long waves of\nhot, hissing sputters. The clouds dropped until they covered the crest of Mount\nThunder.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Great yellow fires began to burn\non the shrouded peak.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>For a time, the company and their\nattackers lay in the ravine as if they were afraid to move. Everyone stared up\nat the fires and the thunderheads.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Suddenly, the flames erupted. With\na roar as if the sir itself were burning, fires started charging like great,\nhungry beasts down every face and side of the mountain.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Shrieking in fear, the Cavewights\nsprang up and ran. A few hurled themselves madly against the walls of the\nravine. But most of them swept around the company's rock and fled downward,\ntrying to outrun the Fire-Lions.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The ur-viles went the other way.\nIn furious haste, they scrambled up the ravine toward the entrance to the\ncatacombs.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>But before they could reach\nsafety, Drool appeared out of the cleft above them. The Cavewight was crawling,\ntoo crippled to stand. But in his fist he clutched a green stone which radiated\nintense wrong through the blackness of the clouds. His scream carried over the\nroar of the Lions:</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Crush! Crush!&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The ur-viles stopped, caught\nbetween fears.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>While the creatures hesitated, the\ncompany started down the ravine. Prothall and Covenant were too exhausted to\nsupport themselves, so the Bloodguard bore them, throwing them from man to man\nover the boulders, dragging them along the tumbled floor of the ravine.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Ahead, the Cavewights began to\nreach the end of the cut. Some of them ran so blindly that they plunged over\nthe cliff; others scattered in either direction along the edge, wailing for\nescape.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>But behind the company, the\nur-viles formed a wedge and again started downward. The Questers were barely\nable to keep their distance from the wedge.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The roar of the flaming air grew\nsharper, fiercer. Set free by the power of the Peak, boulders tumbled from the\ncliffs. The Fire-Lions moved like molten stone, sprang down the slopes as if\nspewed out of the heart of an inferno. Still far above the ravine, the\nconsuming howl of their might seemed to double and treble itself with each\ndownward lunge. A blast of scorched air blew ahead of them like a herald,\ntrumpeting the progress of fire and volcanic hunger. Gravin Threndor shuddered\nto its roots.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The difficulty of the ravine eased\nas the company neared the lower end, and Covenant began to move for himself.\nImpelled by broken vision, overborne hearing, gaining rampage, he shook free of\nthe Bloodguard. Moving stiff-kneed like a puppet, he jerked in a dogged,\nstumbling line for the cliff.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The other Questers swung to the\nsouth along the edge. But he went directly to the precipice. When he reached\nit, his legs barely had the strength to stop him. Tottering weakly, he looked\ndown the drop. It was sheer for two thousand feet, and the cliff was at least\nhalf a league wide.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>There was no escape. The Lions\nwould get the company before they reached any possible descent beyond the cliff\nlong before.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>People yelled at him, warning him\nfutilely; he could hardly hear them through the roaring air. He gave no heed.\nThat kind of escape was not what he wanted. And he was not afraid of the fall:\nhe could not see it clearly enough to be afraid.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>He had something to do.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>He paused for a moment, summoning\nhis courage. Then he realized that one of the Bloodguard would probably try to\nsave him. He wanted to accomplish his purpose before that could happen.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>He needed an answer to death.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Pulling off his ring, he held it\nfirmly in his halffingerless hand, cocked his arm to throw the band over the\ncliff.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>His eyes followed the ring as he\ndrew back his arm, and he stopped suddenly, struck by a blow of shame. The\nmetal was clean. His vision still saw two rings, but both were flat argent; the\nstain was gone from within them.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>He spun from the cliff, searched\nup the ravine for Drool.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>He heard Mhoram shout,\n&quot;Bannor! It is his choice!&quot; The Bloodguard was sprinting toward him.\nAt Mhoram's command, Bannor pulled to a halt ten yards away, despite his Vow.\nThe next instant, he rejected the command, leaped toward Covenant again.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant could not focus his\nvision. He caught a glimpse of fiery Lions pouncing toward the crevice high up\nthe ravine. But his sight was dominated by the ur-vile wedge. It was only three\nstrides away from him. The loremaster had already raised its stave to strike.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Instinctively, Covenant tried to\nmove. But he was too slow. He was still leaning when Bannor crashed into him,\nknocked him out of the way.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>With a mad, exulting bark as if\nthey had suddenly seen a vision, the ur-viles sprang forward as one and plunged\nover the cliff. Their cries as they fell sounded ferociously triumphant.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Bannor lifted Covenant to his\nfeet. The Bloodguard urged him toward the rest of the company, but he broke\nfree and stumbled a few steps up the slope, straining his eyes toward the\ncrevice. &quot;Drool! What happened to Drool?&quot; His eyes failed him. He\nstopped, wavered uncertainly, raged, &quot;I can't see!&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Mhoram hastened to him, and\nCovenant repeated his question, shouting it into the Lord's face.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Mhoram replied gently, &quot;Drool\nis there, in the crevice. Power that he could not master destroys him. He no\nlonger knows what he does. In a moment, the Fire-Lions will consume him.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant strove to master his\nvoice by biting down on it. &quot;No!&quot; he hissed. &quot;He's just another\nvictim. Foul planned this all along:&quot; Despite his clamped teeth, his voice\nsounded broken.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Comfortingly, Mhoram touched his\nshoulder. &quot;Be at peace, Unbeliever. We have done all we can. You need not\ncondemn yourself.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Abruptly, Covenant found that his\nrage was gone collapsed into dust. He felt blasted and wrecked, and he sank to\nthe ground as if his bones could no longer hold him. His eyes had a tattered\nlook, like the sails of a ghost ship. Without caring what he did, he pushed his\nwedding band back onto his ring finger.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The rest of the company was moving\ntoward him. They had given up their attempt at flight; together, they watched\nthe progress of the Lions. The midnight clouds cast a gloom over the whole\nmountain, and through the dimness the pouncing fires blazed and coruscated like\nbeasts of sun flame. They sprang down the walls into the ravine, and some of\nthem bounded upward toward the crevice.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Lord Mhoram finally shook himself\nfree of his entrancement. &quot;Call your Ranyhyn,&quot; he commanded Bannor.\n&quot;The Bloodguard can save themselves. Take the Staff and the Second Ward.\nCall the Ranyhyn and escape.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Bannor met Mhoram's gaze for a\nlong moment, measuring the Lord's order. Then he refused stolidly. &quot;One of\nus will go. To carry the Staff and Ward to Lord's Keep. The rest remain.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Why? We cannot escape. You\nmust live-to serve the Lords who must carry on this war.&quot;\n&quot;Perhaps.&quot; Bannor shrugged slightly. &quot;Who can say? High Lord\nKevin ordered us away, and we obeyed. We will not do such a thing again.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;But this death is\nuseless!&quot; cried Mhoram.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Nevertheless.&quot; The\nBloodguard's tone was as blank as iron. Then he added, &quot;But you can call\nHynaril. Do so, Lord.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;No,&quot; Mhoram sighed with\na tired smile of recognition. &quot;I cannot. How could I leave so many to\ndie?&quot; Covenant only half listened. He felt like a derelict, and he was\npicking among the wreckage of his emotions, in search of something worth\nsalvaging. But part of him understood. He put the two fingers of his right hand\nbetween his lips and gave one short, piercing whistle.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>All the company stared at him.\nQuaan seemed to think that the Unbeliever had lost his mind; Mhoram's eyes\njumped at wild guesses. But Manethrall Lithe tossed her cord high in the air\nand crowed, &quot;The Ranyhyn! Mane of the World! He calls them!&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;How?&quot; protested Quaan.\n&quot;He refused them.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;They reared to him!&quot;\nshe returned with a nickering laugh. &quot;They will come.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant had stopped listening\naltogether. Something was happening to him, and he lurched to his feet to meet\nit upright. The dimensions of his situation were changing. To his blurred gaze,\nthe comrades of the company grew slowly harder and solider-took on the texture\nof native rock. And the mountain itself became increasingly adamantine. It\nseemed as immutable as the cornerstone of the world. He felt veils drop from\nhis perception; he saw the unclouded fact of Gravin Threndor in all its\nunanswerable power. He paled beside it; his flesh grew thin, transient. Air as\nthick as smoke blew through him, chilling his bones. The throat of his soul\ncontracted in silent pain. &quot;What's happening to me?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Around the cliff edge to the\nsouth, Ranyhyn came galloping. Like a blaze of hope, they raced the down rush\nof the Lions. At once, a hoarse cheer broke from the warriors. &quot;We are\nsaved!&quot; Mhoram cried. &quot;There is time enough!&quot; With the rest of\nthe company, he hurried forward to meet the swift approach of the Ranyhyn.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant felt that he had been\nleft alone. &quot;What's happening to me?&quot; he repeated dimly toward the\nhard mountain.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>But Prothall was still at his\nside. Covenant heard the High Lord say in a kind old voice that seemed as loud\nas thunder, &quot;Drool is dead. He was your summoner, and with his death the\ncall ends. That is the way of such power.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Farewell, Unbeliever! Be\ntrue! You have wrought greatly for us. The Ranyhyn will preserve us. And with\nthe Staff of Law and the Second Ward, we will not be unable to defend against\nthe Despiser's ill. Take heart. Despair and bitterness are not the only songs\nin the world.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>But Covenant wailed in mute grief.\nEverything around him-Prothall and the company and the Ranyhyn and the\nFire-Lions and the mountain-became too solid for him. They overwhelmed his\nperceptions,</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>passed beyond his senses into gray\nmist. He clutched about him and felt nothing. He could not see; the Land left\nthe range of his eyes. It was too much for him, and he lost it.<br clear=all\nstyle='page-break-before:always'>\n</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><a name=\"_Toc370739030\"><span class=Heading1Char><span\nstyle='font-size:16.0pt;line-height:105%'>TWENTY-FIVE: Survived</span></span></a></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Gray mist swirled around him for a\nlong convulsive moment. Then it began to smear, and he lost it as well. His\nvision blurred, as if some hard god had rubbed a thumb across it. He blinked\nrapidly, tried to reach up to squeeze his eyes; but something soft prevented\nhis hand. His sight remained blank.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>He was waking up, though he felt\nmore as if he were dropping into grogginess.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Gradually, he became able to identify\nwhere he was. He lay in a bed with tubular protective bars on the sides. White\nsheets covered him to his chin. Gray curtains shut him off from the other\npatients in the room. A fluorescent light stared past him emptily from the\nceiling. The air was faintly tinged with ether and germicide. A call button\nhung at the head of the bed.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>All his fingers and toes were\nnumb.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Nerves don't regenerate, of course\nthey don't, they don't- This was important-he knew it was importantbut for some\nreason it did not carry any weight with him. His heart was too hot with other\nemotions to feel that particular ice.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>What mattered to him was that\nProthall and Mhoram and the Quest had survived. He clung to that as if it were\nproof of sanity-a demonstration that what had happened to him, that what he had\ndone, was not the product of madness, self-destruction. They had survived; at\nleast his bargain with the Ranyhyn had accomplished that much. They had done\nexactly what Lord Foul wanted them to do-but they had survived.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>At least he was not guilty of\ntheir deaths, too. His inability to use his ring, to believe in his ring, had\nnot made Wraiths of them. That was his only consolation for what he had lost.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Then he made out two figures\nstanding at the foot of the bed. One of them was a woman in white-a nurse. As\nhe tried to focus on her, she said, &quot;Doctor -he's regaining\nconsciousness.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The doctor was a middle-aged man\nin a brown suit. The flesh under his eyes sagged as if he were weary of all\nhuman pain, but his lips under his graying mustache were gentle. He approached\nalong the side of the bed, touched Covenant's forehead for a moment, then\npulled up Covenant's eyelids and shined a small light at his pupils.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>With an effort, Covenant focused\non the light.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The doctor nodded, and put his flashlight\naway. &quot;Mr. Covenant?&quot; Covenant swallowed at the dryness in his\nthroat.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Mr. Covenant.&quot; The\ndoctor held his face close to Covenant's, and spoke quietly, calmly.\n&quot;You're in the hospital. You were brought here after your run-in with that\npolice car. You've been unconscious for about four hours.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant lifted his head and\nnodded to show that he understood.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Good,&quot; said the doctor.\n&quot;I'm glad you're coming around. Now, let me talk to you for a moment.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Mr. Covenant, the police\nofficer who was driving that car says that he didn't hit you. He claims that he\nstopped in time-you just fell down in front of him. From my examination, I\nwould be inclined to agree with him. Your hands are scraped up a bit, and you\nhave a bruise on your forehead-but things like that could have happened when\nyou fell.&quot; He hesitated momentarily, then asked, &quot;Did he hit\nyou?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Dumbly, Covenant shook his head.\nThe question did not feel important.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Well, I suppose you could\nhave knocked yourself out by hitting your head on the pavement. But why did you\nfall?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>That, too, did not feel important.\nHe pushed the question away with a twitch of his hands. Then he tried to sit up\nin bed.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>He succeeded before the doctor\ncould help or hinder him; he was not as weak as he had feared he might be. The\nnumbness of his fingers and toes still seemed to lack conviction, as if they\nwould recover as soon as their circulation was restored.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Nerves don't- After a moment, he\nregained his voice, and asked for his clothes.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The doctor studied him closely.\n&quot;Mr. Covenant,&quot; he said, &quot;I'll let you go home if you want to. I\nsuppose I should keep you under observation for a day or two. But I really\nhaven't been able to find anything wrong with you. And you know more about\ntaking care of leprosy than I do.&quot; Covenant did not miss the look of\nnausea that flinched across the nurse's face. &quot;And, to be perfectly\nhonest&quot;-the doctor's tone turned suddenly acid-&quot;`I don't want to have\nto fight the staff here to be sure that you get decent care. Do you feel up to\nit?&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>In answer, Covenant began fumbling\nwith awkward fingers at the dull white hospital gown he wore. Abruptly, the\ndoctor went to a locker, and came back with Covenant's clothes.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant gave them a kind of VSE.\nThey were scuffed and dusty from his fall in the street; yet they looked\nexactly as they had looked when he had last worn them, during the first days of\nthe Quest.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Exactly as if none of it had ever\nhappened.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>When he was dressed, he signed the\nreleases. His hand was so cold that he could hardly write his name.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>But the Quest had survived. At\nleast his bargain had been good for that.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Then the doctor gave him a ride in\na wheelchair down to the discharge exit. Outside the building, the doctor\nsuddenly began to talk as if in some oblique way he were trying to apologize for\nnot keeping Covenant in the hospital. &quot;It must be hell to be a\nleper,&quot; he said rapidly. &quot;I'm trying to understand. It's like I\nstudied in Heidelberg, years ago, and while I was there I saw a lot of medieval\nart. Especially religious</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>art. Being a leper reminds me of\nstatues of the Crucifixion made during the Middle Ages. There is Christ on the\nCross, and his features-his body, even his face-are portrayed so blandly that\nthe figure is unrecognizable. It could be anyone, man or woman. But the\nwounds-the nails in the hands and feet, the spear in the side, the crown of\nthorns-are carved and even painted in incredibly vivid detail. You would think\nthe artist crucified his model to get that kind of realism.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Being a leper must be like\nthat.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Covenant felt the doctor's\nsympathy, but he could not reply to it. He did not know how. After a few\nminutes, an ambulance came and took him back to Haven Farm.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>He had survived.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>He walked up the long driveway to\nhis house as if that were his only hope.</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Here ends </span>LORD FOUL'S BANE,\n<span style='color:black'>Book One of The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant, the\nUnbeliever</span></p>\n\n<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>\n\n</div>\n\n</body>\n\n</html>\n",
