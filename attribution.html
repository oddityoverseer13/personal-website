<p>This site was designed and created entirely by me, Derek Kniffin. It is generated using <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>, and deployed via <a href="https://github.com/dmathieu/glynn">Glynn</a>. The background was taken by me, at <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=34.42400&mlon=-77.54639#map=18/34.42400/-77.54639">Topsail Beach, NC</a>.</p>
<p>I do have to give some credit to some libraries and resources I used in the making of the site. The font for my name on the frontpage is <a href='http://www.1001freefonts.com/daniel.font'>Daniel</a>. The font used in the page content is <a href='http://www.1001freefonts.com/questrial_font.font'>Questrial</a>. The contact icons in the footer are from <a href="http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/">Font Awesome</a>. The code syntax style is a slightly modified version of <a href="http://chriskempson.github.io/base16/#pop">Base16 Pop</a>.</p>
