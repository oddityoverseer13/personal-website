<p>This site was designed and created entirely by me, Derek Kniffin. I created it from scratch, using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. (ie: it doesn't use anything like wordpress, ruby on rails, etc)</p>
<p>I do have to give some credit to some libraries and resources I used in the making of the site. The background images were obtained via <a href="http://www.subtlepatterns.com">Subtle Patterns</a>. I also used a few javascript libraries, including <a href="http://jquery.com">jQuery</a>.</p>
