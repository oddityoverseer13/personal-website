<p>This site was designed and created entirely by me, Derek Kniffin. It is generated using <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>, and deployed via <a href="https://github.com/dmathieu/glynn">Glynn</a>.</p>
<p>I do have to give some credit to some libraries and resources I used in the making of the site. The background images were obtained via <a href="http://www.subtlepatterns.com">Subtle Patterns</a>. The code syntax style is a slightly modified version of <a href="http://chriskempson.github.io/base16/#pop">Base16 Pop</a>.</p>
