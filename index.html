  <span id='hi'>Hi!</span>
  My name is Derek. I'm a web developer and designer. I am well-versed in many parts of the web stack, including UI, Javascript, APIs, backend scripting, databases, and linux. In an ideal day, I spend most of my time writing code. Additionally, I working with data models, and designing user interfaces.

  I am currently a student and employee of The University of Colorado at Boulder. I'm persuing a degree in Computer Science, and plan to graduate in 2015. I also work in CU's OIT sysadmin department as a Database Administrator.

  I'm very passionate about contributing to open-source and open-data projects. I have commited many lines of code to a variety of projects on github. I'm also an active mapper on Openstreetmap.

  In my free time, I like to spend time with my wife, and our energetic lab mix. We love the outdoors, so if the weather is nice, we're usually out exploring and geocaching.
