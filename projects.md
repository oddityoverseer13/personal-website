## Released

- [University of Colorado Campus Map](http://www.colorado.edu/map) - This was a to replace the existing outdated, poorly designed [CU Campus Map](http://www.colorado.edu/campusmap). For more information about the project, see [the map's about page](http://www.colorado.edu/map/about).
- [Openstreemap Webtrees plugin](https://github.com/oddityoverseer13/webtrees-openstreetmap) - This is a plugin for [Webtrees](http://www.webtrees.net) to enable display of map locations on an Leaflet/OSM map. There are plans to make it better in the future.

## In Progress

- Bing housenumber detection - For my CS senior project, I'm working with a group of developers, and with the Bing imagery team, to develop a solution to extract interesting features (such as house numbers, or un-blurred faces) from Bing Streetside images. Unfortunately, we're not far enough along for a demo of the project to be available, so no link on this one, yet.
- [Zmby](https://github.com/oddityoverseer13/zmby) - In my Object Oriented Analysis and Design class, we're tasked with creating a project that allows us to practice our design and programming skills. My group has decided on creating a text-based game, powered by Ruby. If we get far enough along, we will consider hosting it in a Rails site, but we wanted to start with less complexity.
- [Kinship](https://github.com/oddityoverseer13/kinship) - A Ruby on Rails genealogy application. Development for this started out as a project for a CS class, and now I'm working on developing into an alternative to [Webtrees](http://www.webtrees.net).
- Osm2obj - A Ruby program to convert OSM and STRM data into 3D models of an area. The output files are specifically aimed at importing into Unity for game development.

## On Hold

- [MusicJS](https://github.com/oddityoverseer13/musicjs) (working title) - This is a desktop music management application, powered by node-webkit (nodejs+chromium). I started development on this after switching to archbang for my desktop environment, and trying to find a good music management application (an alternative to MediaMonkey). For more info, see the readme in the repo. *This is on hold until I get some time to work on it some more.*
- [Berries](http://github.com/oddityoverseer13/berries) - A 3D Mapping library. This started out as a project for a CS graphics class, where I explored WebGL and three.js. The intent will be for this to be a 3D alternative to [http://www.leafletjs.com](Leaflet). *This is on hold because it has a lower priority than other projects.*
- [Webtrees SVG Tree Plugin](https://github.com/oddityoverseer13/webtrees-svgtree) - The objective of this is to create an alternative to webtrees' existing tree views, which are all based on HTML tables (ick). This plugin uses SVG to create a tree view of the genealogy data in the site. The other improvement this plugin aims to make is the ability to show a "kinship" tree; ie: one that shows siblings, and spouses, in addition to ancestors and decendants. *This project is on hold in favor of Kinship (see above) development.*
