I'm just getting started with [Jekyll](http://http://jekyllrb.com/ "Jekyll"), and I wish I had known about it before. It's a great website generation tool. I've been trying to solve the problem of how to [DRY](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_repeat_yourself) out my personal website. I didn't want to move to something as involved as [RoR](http://rubyonrails.org/) because 1) it's overkill, and 2) It would require me to have my site hosted with someone who supports it, which I don't.

Jekyll solves the this problem by simply generating static html; it doesn't aim to be a full-fledged framework, but instead lets you generate a website via templates.
